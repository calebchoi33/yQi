## Installation

1. Clone or download this project
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd evaluation
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Setup

### OpenAI API Key

You need an OpenAI API key to use this application. You can obtain one from [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

**Option 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

**Option 2: Enter in the App**
The app will prompt you to enter your API key in the sidebar if it's not found in the environment.

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to the provided URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`)

3. **Generate Responses Tab:**
   - Choose to use default prompts or enter custom ones
   - Enter your OpenAI API key if not set as environment variable
   - Click "Generate Responses" to send prompts to ChatGPT
   - Watch the progress bar as responses are collected

4. **View Responses Tab:**
   - View all saved responses in an organized format
   - See summary metrics (total prompts, tokens used, generation date)
   - Download the JSON file with all responses

## Default Medical Cases

The application comes with 20 default Chinese medical case prompts covering:
1. **Respiratory conditions** - fever, cough, pneumonia symptoms
2. **Gastrointestinal issues** - digestive problems, diarrhea, constipation
3. **Cardiovascular symptoms** - palpitations, chest tightness
4. **Allergies and skin conditions** - seasonal allergies, dermatitis
5. **Urological problems** - kidney stones, UTI symptoms
6. **Pediatric cases** - ADHD, Tourette's, bedwetting
7. **Gynecological conditions** - menstrual irregularities, menopause
8. **Mental health cases** - depression, anxiety, OCD
9. **Complex conditions** - cancer recovery, genetic disorders

Each prompt requests:
- **Chain of thought analysis**: TCM diagnostic reasoning including symptom analysis and syndrome differentiation
- **Chinese herbal prescriptions**: Specific herbs and dosages for treatment

## Application Structure

The application has been refactored into a modular structure for better maintainability and separation of concerns:

- **app.py** - Main Streamlit application entry point
- **config.py** - Configuration constants and default prompts
- **api_client.py** - OpenAI API interaction with retry logic
- **file_manager.py** - File operations for saving/loading responses and benchmarks
- **ui_components.py** - Streamlit UI components and display functions

## File Storage

The application creates organized directories for data storage:

### Responses Directory (`responses/`)
Stores ChatGPT responses in timestamped files: `responses_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-20T00:30:00.123456",
  "total_prompts": 20,
  "responses": [
    {
      "prompt_number": 1,
      "prompt": "ÁóÖ‰∫∫ÔºåÁî∑Ôºå25Ê≠≤Ôºå‰∫ûË£î...",
      "response": "‰∏≠ÈÜ´Ë®∫Êñ∑ÂàÜÊûê: ...",
      "tokens_used": 450,
      "timestamp": "2025-08-20T00:30:05.123456"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Benchmarks Directory (`benchmarks/`)
Stores performance metrics in timestamped files: `benchmark_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`

```json
{
  "run_id": "20250820_003000",
  "model": "gpt-4o",
  "total_duration_seconds": 45.2,
  "total_tokens_used": 8500,
  "success_rate": 1.0,
  "tokens_per_second": 188.1,
  "prompt_processing_times": [...]
}
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit 1.32.0
- OpenAI Python library 1.6.1
- python-dotenv 1.0.0
- Valid OpenAI API key with GPT-4o access

## Cost Considerations

This app uses the **GPT-4o model** with a maximum of 500 tokens per response. GPT-4o is more expensive than GPT-3.5-turbo but provides superior reasoning capabilities for complex medical analysis.

Cost factors:
- **20 default prompts** per evaluation run
- **Complex medical prompts** requiring detailed TCM analysis
- **GPT-4o pricing** (higher than GPT-3.5-turbo)
- **Benchmark data** tracks exact token usage for cost monitoring

Always monitor your OpenAI usage dashboard to track costs. The benchmarking feature provides detailed token usage analytics for cost analysis.

## Troubleshooting

**API Key Issues:**
- Ensure your API key is valid and has sufficient credits
- Check that the key is properly set in environment variables or entered in the app

**Connection Issues:**
- Verify your internet connection
- Check if OpenAI services are operational
- The application includes retry logic for API rate limits and connection errors
- Check the log files (`api_client.log`, `file_manager.log`, `ui_components.log`) for detailed error information

**Rate Limit Handling:**
- The application will automatically retry API calls when rate limits are encountered
- Default retry settings can be adjusted in `config.py` (MAX_RETRIES and RETRY_DELAY)

**Installation Issues:**
- Make sure you're using Python 3.7 or higher
- Try upgrading pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
- Ensure all dependencies are installed with the correct versions: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
