Based on the patient's symptoms, the following TCM diagnostic analysis can be made:\n\n1. **Symptom Analysis**:\n   - **Cough with abundant phlegm**: Indicates accumulation of phlegm in the lungs, possibly due to external cold or internal dietary issues.\n   - **White and thick phlegm**: Typically associated with cold and dampness, indicating obstruction from cold pathogens affecting lung function.\n   - **Chest tightness and shortness of breath**: Suggests insufficient lung qi or obstruction from phlegm dampness, affecting the flow of qi.\n   - **Worsening with activity**: Symptoms exacerbated by movement indicate impaired lung function, likely related to the history of chronic bronchitis.\n   - **Pale tongue with white slippery coating**: A pale tongue indicates qi and blood deficiency, while a white slippery coating suggests the presence of phlegm dampness.\n   - **Slippery pulse**: Indicates phlegm dampness or food stagnation.\n\n2. **Syndrome Differentiation**:\n   - Based on the above symptoms, the patient's syndrome can be identified as \"Phlegm-Damp Obstructing the Lungs\" or \"Lung Qi Deficiency\".\n   - The main characteristics include phlegm damp accumulation affecting lung function, leading to cough, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.\n\n**Recommended Herbal Prescription**:\n1. **Er Chen Tang** (for phlegm transformation):\n   - Ban Xia (Pinellia): 10g (descends qi and transforms phlegm)\n   - Chen Pi (Aged Tangerine Peel): 10g (regulates qi and transforms phlegm)\n   - Gan Cao (Licorice): 6g (harmonizes the formula)\n   - Sheng Jiang (Fresh Ginger): 3 slices (aids digestion and transforms phlegm)\n   - Da Zao (Jujube): 3 pieces (tonifies qi)\n\n2. **Modified Er Chen Tang** (additional herbs based on the patient's condition):\n   - Cang Er Zi (Xanthium): 6g (opens the nasal passages and transforms phlegm)\n   - Jie Geng (Platycodon): 10g (opens the lungs and benefits the throat)\n   - Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogon): 10g (moistens the lungs and generates fluids)\n\n**Dosage**:\n- The above herbs can be decocted in water, and the decoction should be taken three times a day, divided into doses.\n\n**Treatment Principles**:\n- Transform phlegm, stop cough, and promote lung function.\n\n**Lifestyle Recommendations**:\n- Advise the patient to avoid cold and damp environments and maintain good indoor ventilation.\n- Dietary recommendations should focus on light, easily digestible foods, avoiding greasy and spicy items.\n- Encourage moderate exercise to promote recovery of lung function.",
