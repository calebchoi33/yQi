When observing blood in the blood vessels, it is red; however, when viewed through a layer of skin, the color of the blood appears yellow. This indicates that the water in the blood has been depleted. What is seen through the skin is the color of the blood, so this type of yellowing is not due to liver or gallbladder disease; do not confuse it. This yellowing is caused by dehydration. In severe cases, when the body has lost too much body fluid, the brain does not receive adequate blood for nourishment, which can lead to convulsions. The liver governs the tendons, and the tendons rely on blood for nourishment. Without sufficient blood supply, cramps will occur, leading to spasms that tighten and then relax repeatedly. \"Spasm\" refers to the tendons relaxing, while \"tightening\" refers to them contracting.\n\n\"If exposed to fire, one reversal still draws the sun, and another reversal hastens the life span.\" If a mistake is made, it can still be corrected; however, if fire is used to roast again, and the water in the blood is completely depleted, it will be fatal.

          "english_text": "If the illness manifests at night, it is considered to arise from Yin. By daytime, it begins to be counted as a new day; therefore, the day after the onset of the illness is regarded as the first day. After a full six days, specifically at midnight of the sixth day, it will resolve on its own, hence the saying \"healing in six days.\" Regardless of whether it is a Yin or Yang illness, if one contracts a cold, it is expected to improve within six days under normal circumstances. Thus, if one does not take medication for a cold, it will typically resolve within a week.\n\nThe terms \"Yin\" and \"Yang\" have broad interpretations. When distinguishing between cold and heat, cold is classified as \"Yin\" and heat as \"Yang.\" When differentiating between exterior and interior, the exterior is \"Yang\" and the interior is \"Yin.\" In terms of organs, the solid organs are \"Yin\" while the hollow organs are \"Yang.\" When considering the upper and lower parts of the body, the upper is \"Yang\" and the lower is \"Yin.\" From a left-right perspective, the left side is \"Yang\" and the right side is \"Yin.\" When dividing by Qi and blood, Qi is \"Yang\" and blood is \"Yin.\" In terms of deficiency and excess, deficiency is \"Yin\" and excess is \"Yang.\" Additionally, substances such as bodily secretions, moisture, and plasma are referred to as \"Yin,\" while intangible aspects such as the body's resistance, cellular metabolism, and the natural functions of various organs are referred to as \"Yang.\"\n\nRegarding \"Taiyang disease,\" if there is a headache that resolves on its own after seven days, it is due to the completion of its meridian. If one wishes to induce another cycle, one should needle the \"Foot Yangming\" point to prevent the meridian from transmitting, thus facilitating recovery.\n\nFor headaches that resolve on their own, they typically improve within a week. If a cold has not improved by the seventh day, it is advisable to seek medical attention promptly. In the case of Taiyang disease, it may sometimes transmit to Yangming or Shaoyang, or transition from Yangming to Shaoyang, or vice versa; this is not fixed. If Taiyang disease has not yet progressed to the Foot Yangming stage, needling the primary point of Foot Yangming, \"Zusanli,\" will prevent further transmission.",

If there is a Taiyang disease, before it reaches the foot Yangming, if you first needle the primary point of foot Yangming, \"Zusanli,\" it will not transmit. Before it reaches foot Shaoyang, if you first needle the primary point of the Gallbladder meridian, \"Linqi,\" it will not transmit. If by the sixth day and into the seventh day it has not improved, it may have transmitted to Yangming or Shaoyang. If a child has not improved by the seventh day and begins to show nausea and vomiting, it indicates transmission to Shaoyang. Yangming heat corresponds to the Large Intestine meridian, as the body fluids have dried up, causing constipation in the Large Intestine. If the child becomes irritable, refuses to eat, throws things around, runs wildly at night, and fiddles with clothes and the bed, it indicates transmission to Yangming. The strong heat of Yangming is actually caused by the turbid qi of the stool rising to the brain.\n\n11. When \"Taiyang disease\" is to be resolved, it occurs from \"Si\" to \"Wei.\"\nBecause the disease is in Yang, after six full days, by noon of the seventh day, it is indeed six full days, which is from Si time to Wei time. At noon, it resolves. Therefore, when prescribing for a patient with Taiyang disease, if they take the medicine at nine o'clock in the evening, by ten o'clock, the symptoms will have disappeared, with only a slight dizziness remaining. By the next noon, their spirit will have completely recovered, indicating that the illness is fully resolved. If the illness is in Yin, for example, in a Shaoyin condition, by midnight, if they start looking for something to eat, it indicates recovery. If the illness is in Yang, by the next noon, if they have a strong appetite and eat vigorously, it indicates recovery.\n\n12. For \"wind stroke,\" if the exterior is resolved but the patient remains unwell, recovery will occur in twelve days.\nIf one contracts a cold or wind stroke, takes medicine, and the exterior symptoms are resolved, but the patient still feels unwell, meaning they are lethargic and uncomfortable, and their spirit has not fully recovered, if they do not take medicine, they will recover in twelve days. If they take a comforting soup...\n\n--- \n\nThis translation maintains the technical terminology and concepts of Traditional Chinese Medicine while accurately conveying the original meaning.",

This is termed \"elimination from within,\" which indicates imminent death.\n\nIn febrile disease, the exterior symptoms are present: aversion to cold, fear of cold, and generalized soreness in the bones and joints. However, upon palpating the patient's pulse, it is slow, and the pulse signs do not match. Yet, the patient is treated with Huangqin Decoction to clear the heat. The slow pulse indicates cold; now, with Huangqin Decoction, the heat is again eliminated. Huangqin Decoction is a remedy that clears heat and induces diarrhea.

If there is \"pain in the throat, it indicates obstruction in the throat,\" meaning that the virus has migrated to the throat, causing pain. If there is \"fever without sweating, the diarrhea must stop,\" it means that the heat cannot dissipate and will descend; thus, the diarrhea must cease. \"If it does not stop, it will lead to pus and blood,\" indicating that hepatitis-related substances have emerged, causing throat pain. If it does not descend to the throat, the diarrhea will result in pus and blood; \"if there is pus and blood, the throat will not be obstructed.\" Therefore, if there is pus and blood, the throat will not hurt. The inflammatory filterable virus cannot be eliminated by herbal medicine or the immune system; it must have an outlet.

In a state of insufficient gastrointestinal fluids, it is crucial not to induce sweating, as the source of sweat is the fluids from the gastrointestinal tract. Inducing sweat inappropriately can cause mouth sores and redness, as it will bring the mucus from the liver to the mouth. When experiencing a cold and fever, sweating can be used for resolution; however, in the case of Jueyin syndrome, sweating is not permissible, as the filterable virus resides in the liver.",

          "english_text": "Here is the translation of the provided Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) text:\n\n---\n\nThe condition has arrived. When experiencing a cold with fever, sweating is used to resolve it. However, if it is a case of Jueyin syndrome, sweating should not be used. In Jueyin syndrome, filtered viruses reside in the liver, and sweating from the skin is unrelated to the liver; instead, it further damages the fluids of the gastrointestinal tract and harms the immune system.\n\nSection 351: \"In cases of cold damage,\" if there is Jue (a state of cold) for five days and heat for five days, if on the sixth day there is a return of Jue, it is not Jue if the person recovers on their own. Jue does not last more than five days, and heat lasts for five days, hence it is known that self-recovery occurs.\n\nIf a person has been in a coma for five days and has had heat for five days, by the sixth day they should feel cold; if the patient does not feel cold, it indicates that the illness is improving, which signifies the restoration of stomach qi, and thus they will not feel cold anymore.\n\nSection 352: In all cases of Jue, the yin and yang qi are not harmoniously connected, resulting in Jue. Jue manifests as coldness in the hands and feet.\n\nJue refers to the hands and feet being cold up to the elbows and knees. The disharmony of yin and yang qi indicates an obstruction in blood circulation. When blood circulation is smooth, the person feels warm; when it is obstructed, especially when the heart is weak, the person may become comatose.\n\nSection 353: \"In cases of cold damage,\" the pulse is weak and there is Jue. After seven or eight days, the skin feels cold, and the person is restless, unable to find peace; this is known as concealed Jue, which is different from the Jue caused by parasites.\n\nSection 354: In cases of parasitic Jue, the person often vomits parasites. In the current patient, there is stillness, yet they are intermittently agitated; this indicates parasitic Jue. The parasites ascend into the diaphragm, causing agitation, which may cease momentarily. If the person eats and then vomits and feels agitated, it is because the parasites sense the smell of food and will likely cause the person to vomit parasites. For parasitic Jue, \"Wumei Pill\" is the primary treatment and is also indicated for prolonged diarrhea.\n\nThe patient exhibits signs of agitation, with a weak pulse, showing characteristics of Shaoyin and Jueyin. In Shaoyin syndrome, agitation and inability to lie down persist continuously, while in Jueyin syndrome, agitation may fluctuate between being agitated and calm; this is a case of organ Jue, which is different from parasitic Jue. \"In cases of parasitic Jue, the person often vomits parasites,\" indicating that the parasites are expelled from the mouth.\n\n--- \n\nThis translation maintains the technical terminology and concepts of Traditional Chinese Medicine while ensuring clarity and accuracy in the English language.",

          "english_text": "The restlessness can sometimes be intense and sometimes not; this is known as \"Zang Jue\" (organ collapse), which is different from \"Xian Jue\" (worm collapse). \"Xian Jue\" refers to a condition where the person often vomits worms, which are expelled from the mouth. \"In the current patient, there are times of calmness and times of restlessness.\" This indicates \"Xian Jue,\" suggesting that there are worms in the abdomen, leading to this phenomenon. \"When the worms ascend to the diaphragm, it causes restlessness,\" as the worms moving upwards create a sense of agitation. \"When food is ingested, it leads to vomiting,\" because \"the worms sense the smell of food and will cause the person to vomit worms.\" For \"Xian Jue,\" the treatment is \"Wu Mei Wan,\" which not only expels worms but also addresses prolonged diarrhea. \n\nIn fact, patients who develop \"Xian Jue\" often have a stomach that is too cold. When the stomach is excessively cold, it is prone to the growth of worms. This is why it is included in the \"Jue Yin\" syndrome. The coldness in the stomach is related to the liver; the liver is the organ responsible for detoxification. The toxins in the body are eliminated by the liver, but if the liver is cold, its detoxification function is not very strong. When entering the \"Jue Yin\" syndrome, many viruses can accumulate in the liver, and with the liver's detoxification function not operating normally, it becomes easy for worms to grow in the stomach. The temperature of the worms aligns with the human body temperature; when a person eats, the worms also consume food. If the stomach is cold and not receiving food, the worms inside experience hunger and cold. When the worms are hungry, they move upwards, causing the patient to feel very restless. \n\nOn the patient's lips, one can observe white spots, and the patient may also experience abdominal pain. Generally speaking, abdominal pain indicates internal cold. When there is internal cold, \"Xiao Jian Zhong Tang\" should be used with a heavy emphasis on \"Shao Yao\" (Peony), which is used at double the amount of \"Gui Zhi\" (Cinnamon Twig). In cases of internal cold, the pulse should be deep and tight.",

If too much sweat is produced, naturally the body fluids will be inadequate, leading to reduced urination.\n\nIf purging is applied, there may be direct vision issues and loss of urination. The essence of Zhang Zhongjing's \"Shang Han Lun\" is that when a patient has an exterior syndrome, one must first resolve the exterior before attacking the interior. If too much sweating is induced, it can damage the body fluids; if the interior is attacked too quickly, it can also harm the body fluids. If one attacks the interior without first resolving the exterior, it may result in the complete expulsion of all contents from the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine, leading to a sudden loss of nutrition. The body relies on the food that is continuously being digested to provide energy. If everything is expelled suddenly and the source is lost, the body will lack strength, and the patient may appear dazed, with urination flowing out. This urination is not merely a small amount; it is leaking out.\n\nThe liver stores blood and the soul, and it governs the eyes. We have one-fifth of our blood in the liver, and this blood is not fixed but continuously circulates. If the source is suddenly lost, the liver blood will become depleted.

What is seen through the skin is the color of the blood, so this type of yellowing is not due to liver or gallbladder disease; do not confuse it. This yellowing is caused by dehydration. In severe cases, when the body loses too much fluid, the brain does not receive adequate blood for nourishment, which can lead to convulsions.

If Taiyang disease has not yet progressed to the Foot Yangming stage, needling the primary point of Foot Yangming, \"Zusanli\" (ST36), will prevent further transmission.",

Clinically, there are more women with hemorrhoids than men. Pressing on \"Kong Zui\" or \"Cheng Shan\" will reveal tender points indicating the presence of hemorrhoids. Another cause of purulent blood in the stool is excessive heat in the blood, with insufficient fluids in the blood.

However, the patient has dampness inside. When Ma Huang Decoction induces sweating, it only addresses the exterior symptoms, but the internal dampness remains. Dampness is associated with the spleen, which is yellow and represents the earth element; it is associated with yin. Sweating is derived from the fluids of the gastrointestinal tract, and because sweating mobilizes the internal dampness, the dampness rises, leading to the observed yellowing.

In \"Shang Han\" (Febrile Diseases), if after seven to eight days the body appears yellow like an orange, with difficulty in urination and slight abdominal fullness, \"Yin Chen Hao Decoction\" is indicated. The yellowish color like that of an orange indicates yang jaundice, which signifies heat. Difficulty in urination and slight abdominal fullness suggest that dampness is unable to be discharged and is constricted in the lower abdomen, leading to obstruction and difficulty in urination. When heat and dampness congeal in the lower jiao, \"Yin Chen Hao Decoction\" is used.\n\n275. In \"Shang Han,\" if there is stasis heat within, the body will inevitably turn yellow, and \"Zhi Zi Bai Pi Decoction\" is indicated. Huang Bai (Phellodendron) is a herb that can clear heat from the lower jiao. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, heat corresponds to inflammation in Western medicine; for instance, Huang Bai is often used for urethritis. Zhi Zi (Gardenia) can clear heat from the upper jiao, while Huang Qin (Scutellaria), Huang Lian (Coptis), and Gan Cao (Licorice) can clear heat from the middle jiao. Therefore, Zhi Zi Bai Pi Decoction is another formula for treating jaundice, distinct from Yin Chen Hao Decoction. The latter addresses dampness obstructing the intestines, which is why it contains Da Huang (Rhubarb). The heat in Zhi Zi Bai Pi Decoction is stasis located in the San Jiao (Three Burners), which includes the upper jiao, middle jiao, and lower jiao, indicating inflammation in the lymphatic system. Patients using Zhi Zi Bai Pi Decoction may experience difficulty in urination and abdominal distension, while those using Yin Chen Hao Decoction have difficulty in urination due to stasis heat in the intestines. Thus, these are two formulas for yang jaundice: if the patient is completely yellow, with a very distended abdomen and difficulty in both urination and defecation, then Yin Chen Hao Decoction is appropriate; if urination and defecation are normal and the abdomen is not distended, then Zhi Zi Bai Pi Decoction is indicated. Both formulas are relatively cool and are used in cases of heat diseases.\n\nZhi Zi Bai Pi Decoction is also often used as an eye wash for red, painful, and inflamed eyes. After preparing the decoction, it is filtered through a sieve for use in washing the eyes. \n\n《類聚方》",

The damp-heat in the alcohol is quite strong, so Atractylodes is used; however, the dampness needs a pathway for elimination. Alisma itself can promote urination, relying on its ability to expel dampness, thus allowing the dampness to be discharged through urination. Therefore, for those who have consumed too much alcohol before today and have developed gastric prolapse, using Wu Zhu Yu Decoction can help treat the stomach. Each time after drinking, using Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with an increased dosage of Ban Xia is recommended, as Ban Xia can stop vomiting, preventing nausea and the urge to vomit. Drinking alcohol will then lead to urination, and if too much is consumed, Atractylodes and Alisma should be used.\n\nSection 281: If there has been vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, or warming needling, and the \"Chai Hu Decoction syndrome\" has ceased, this indicates a serious illness.

The upper Guan pulse is elevated, meaning the Guan pulse has jumped upwards. The right Guan corresponds to the spleen and stomach, while the left Guan corresponds to the gallbladder. If the Guan pulse has jumped to the inch position, it indicates that Yang heat is moving towards the upper jiao, as the gallbladder and stomach are too hot, causing bile to reverse, leading to a bitter taste in the mouth. This indicates that the heat from the stomach and gallbladder is rising, representing the need for Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. Therefore, by palpating the pulse, one can understand the progression of the body's condition. \"Yet the patient desires to sleep,\" indicates that the patient's vitality has already been significantly depleted during the Tai Yang phase.

Sometimes, it is not necessary to give the patient medication, as the illness may not necessarily progress. Each person's constitution is different; generally speaking, those who do not take Western medicine for many years and have a strong immune system will not have the illness enter the Yin stage, because Western medicine can significantly weaken the immune system.\n\nSection 285: \"In cases of cold damage\" for three days, if the pulse in the Shaoyang is weak, it indicates that the illness is about to resolve. Regardless of whether it is Shaoyang or Yangming, when the pulse begins to slow down, it indicates that the illness is on the path to recovery. If the patient's pulse is very normal, and there is nausea with a pulse of four beats per breath, this is a sign of pregnancy; it is not an illness. For a normal person, if the pulse is normal but there are discomfort symptoms, it indicates conception has occurred, and one should not casually prescribe medication.\n\nSection 286: When a Shaoyang illness is about to resolve, it occurs from the Yin (寅) to the Chen (辰) hours. This is because the East corresponds to the Wood element (甲乙寅卯), and Shaoyang is associated with Wood; therefore, when a Shaoyang illness is about to resolve, it occurs from the Yin to the Chen hours.\n\nThe above discusses the Shaoyang syndrome.\n\nDifferentiating the Taiyin illness, pulse signs, and treatment methods:\nTaiyin is referred to as \"beginning Yin,\" while Shaoyin is \"within Yin,\" and Jueyin is \"the end of Yin,\" representing the extremity of Yin. When one first enters the Shaoyin stage, it becomes dangerous if it progresses to the Jueyin stage without treatment. Traditional Chinese Medicine aims to prevent the three Yin organs from being affected by pathogenic factors; the initial stage is always Taiyin. Therefore, when Zhang Zhongjing prescribed formulas, he always considered the issues related to Taiyin, regardless of whether the illness had progressed to Shaoyin or Jueyin, because the initial onset of illness occurs in the Taiyin stage.\n\nTaiyin corresponds to the spleen. Generally, those whose illness progresses into the spleen are individuals with a weak stomach. In TCM, the spleen and stomach are interrelated; the spleen and stomach are the foundation of postnatal health. Those who are healthy in the postnatal stage have a strong spleen and stomach.",

This condition is characterized by systemic cold and dampness; to eliminate dampness, we rely on Bai Zhu, which can be used at five qian (a traditional unit of weight). This dosage is suitable for individuals with a larger body mass. The dampness must have an outlet, which is facilitated by Fu Ling, allowing it to be expelled through urination. To dispel the cold, we use Pao Fu (processed Aconite), at three qian, and add some fresh ginger to harmonize it in the stomach. Most importantly, we include \"Sheng Fu\" (raw Aconite), one piece, as Pao Fu strengthens the interior Yang and eliminates the interior cold. The cold in the muscles and the Sanjiao oil network is entirely removed by Sheng Fu. After taking this treatment, the patient will experience an increase in urination, and their stools will become loose and watery. After three doses, the tongue coating will return to normal, and appetite will significantly improve. In clinical practice, patients with uremia have shown a decrease in their uremic index from 180 to 130 after taking one dose. Pao Fu warms the middle, while Sheng Fu warms the channels, benefiting the blood vessels and nerves. This is the main formula, and in clinical practice, adjustments can be made based on the patient's additional symptoms. If the appetite is poor and there is frequent nausea, we can add Ban Xia (Pinellia). This approach can be extended similarly. Some patients with chronic illnesses, after taking the medicine to eliminate cold and dampness, may experience phenomena such as vomiting \"white fluids\" or loose stools, which will improve when the patient begins to feel thirsty.\n\n#FORMULA\n\nZang Jie Decoction:\nChai Hu 5 qian, Bai Zhu 5 qian, Fu Ling 5 qian, Pao Fu 3 qian, Sheng Fu 1 piece.\n\nThis is the main formula; other adjustments should be made based on the clinical situation. \n\n#SECTION",

In cases of \"cold damage,\" if there is vomiting or diarrhea, and after seven to eight days there is no resolution, with heat accumulating internally, both the exterior and interior are hot, with occasional sweating, aversion to wind, great thirst, and agitation, the tongue is dry, and the patient desires to drink several sheng of water, \"Bai Hu Jia Ren Shen Tang\" is indicated.\n\nIn cases of cold damage, the exterior and sweating methods should be used. However, after vomiting and diarrhea, the stomach's fluids are certainly harmed, and if there is no improvement after seven to eight days, it results in \"heat accumulating internally, with both the exterior and interior being hot.\" There is an internal illness, and the exterior is also affected. Where does the internal heat come from? It arises because the fluids are damaged; the heat in the body is trapped within the fluids and also within the blood. A portion of the heat, after the fluids are harmed, escapes from the fluids and the blood and rises to the surface, causing internal heat. The first organ to be affected is the lung, which governs the skin and hair. At this time, the patient often feels sweaty, fears the wind, experiences great thirst and agitation. When the upper jiao is too dry and hot, it is because the fluids are depleted; the upper jiao is like the sky without clouds, with the sun shining directly, making it very hot. This is the pattern of Bai Hu Tang, as the yang of the chest is elevated, and the heart and lungs have a certain level of moisture. The chest is already very hot, and the heat from the stomach rises, with all the fluids lost and sweated out, resulting in a \"dry tongue.\" When the tongue is extended, there is not a drop of saliva; it can be severe enough that the tongue coating turns upward. \"Desiring to drink several sheng of water\" indicates extreme thirst, and even after drinking for a long time, the thirst cannot be quenched, because the water that enters the stomach moves downward and cannot be absorbed. The true absorption of water relies on the gastric fluids to resolve it, but if the gastric fluids have been completely vomited out, they are gone.",

          "english_text": "When water enters the stomach, it moves downward and cannot be absorbed because the actual absorption of water relies on gastric juices to break it down. As a result, if the gastric juices are completely expelled, there is nothing left to convert the water into vapor, causing the water to flow directly downward, failing to quench thirst. This is indicative of the \"Bai Hu Jia Ren Shen Tang\" syndrome.\n\n\"Bai Hu Jia Ren Shen Tang\" is a formula in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for treating diabetes with upper digestive issues, and it is also one of the best remedies for \"heat in the heart.\" It does not matter if there are exterior symptoms; if there is internal heat, particularly when heat is present in the chest, \"Bai Hu Jia Ren Shen Tang\" should be used. The Bai Hu Tang syndrome is characterized by dryness, thirst, and irritability. Therefore, when prescribing Bai Hu Tang to a patient, their external condition may be perceived as a mental illness, where they frequently lose their temper. This can lead Western medicine to diagnose it as a psychiatric disorder, while TCM recognizes it as dryness and thirst, with body fluids depleted, making it difficult to control emotions. \n\nWhy is Ren Shen (ginseng) added? Generally, people do not need to take ginseng unless there is a deficiency of body fluids. Ginseng is often used in gastroenterology, which is why it is commonly included in formulas like Xie Xin Tang. When ginseng is administered, it quickly replenishes the body fluids. Once the fluids are restored, Bai Hu Tang can effectively reduce the heat, and the best substance for cooling down the heat is gypsum. \n\nCurrently, there is a condition associated with diabetes where blood sugar levels can drop too low, leading to rapid hunger, and patients often need to consume sugar. Bai Hu Tang is also applicable in these cases.\n\nNow, regarding monosodium glutamate (MSG) in food, consuming it leads to persistent thirst and an unquenchable desire for water, which is also a manifestation of the Bai Hu Tang syndrome. When MSG is ingested, it directly transforms into the Bai Hu Tang syndrome without passing through any exterior symptoms. This indicates its harmful effects on the human body, which is why we advise against adding MSG to food.",

Mistakenly inducing sweat can cause mouth sores and redness, bringing the mucus from the liver into the mouth. When experiencing a cold or fever, sweating can be used to resolve it; however, in the case of Jueyin syndrome, sweating should not be used, as the filterable virus resides in the liver.",

          "english_text": "Here is the translation of the provided Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) text:\n\n---\n\nThe condition has arrived. When experiencing a cold with fever, sweating is used to resolve it. However, if it is a case of Jueyin syndrome, sweating should not be used. In Jueyin syndrome, filtered viruses reside in the liver, and sweating from the skin is unrelated to the liver; instead, it further damages the fluids of the gastrointestinal tract and harms the immune system.\n\nSection 351: \"In cases of cold damage,\" if Jue occurs for five days, and heat also lasts for five days, if it is expected to revert to Jue on the sixth day, but does not revert, then self-recovery occurs. Jue does not last more than five days, and heat lasts for five days, hence it is known that self-recovery is possible.\n\nIf there is a coma for five days, followed by heat for five days, by the sixth day, the patient should feel cold; however, if the patient does not feel cold, it indicates that the illness is improving, which signifies the restoration of stomach qi, and thus the patient will not feel cold.\n\nSection 352: Any case of Jue indicates that the yin and yang qi are not harmoniously connected, resulting in Jue. Jue manifests as coldness in the hands and feet.\n\nJue refers to the hands and feet being cold up to the elbows and knees. The disharmony of yin and yang qi indicates an obstruction in blood circulation. When blood circulation is smooth, the person feels warm; when it is obstructed, and the heart is weakened, the person may fall into a coma.\n\nSection 353: \"In cases of cold damage,\" the pulse is weak and Jue occurs. After seven or eight days, the skin feels cold, and the person is restless, unable to find peace; this is known as concealed Jue, which is different from the Jue caused by parasites.\n\nSection 354: In cases of parasitic Jue, the person often vomits parasites. In the current patient, there is stillness, yet there is a return of restlessness; this indicates parasitic Jue. The parasites ascend and enter the diaphragm, causing restlessness, which may temporarily cease. If the person eats and then vomits and feels restless, it indicates that the parasites sense the smell of food and will likely be expelled. For parasitic Jue, \"Wumei Pill\" is the main treatment, and it also addresses prolonged diarrhea.\n\nThe patient exhibits signs of restlessness, with a weak pulse, showing characteristics of Shaoyin and Jueyin. In Shaoyin syndrome, restlessness and inability to lie down persist continuously, while in Jueyin syndrome, restlessness may fluctuate between agitation and calmness; this is known as organ Jue, which is different from parasitic Jue. \"In cases of parasitic Jue, the person often vomits parasites,\" indicating that the parasites are expelled from the mouth.\n\n--- \n\nThis translation maintains the technical terminology and concepts of Traditional Chinese Medicine while accurately conveying the original meaning.",

          "english_text": "The restlessness can sometimes be intense and sometimes not; this is known as \"Zang Jue\" (organ reversal), which is different from \"Xian Jue\" (worm reversal). \"Xian Jue\" refers to a condition where the person often vomits worms, which are expelled from the mouth. \"In the current case, the patient is calm at times but also experiences periods of restlessness.\" This indicates \"Xian Jue,\" suggesting that there are worms in the abdomen, leading to this phenomenon. \"When the worms ascend and enter the diaphragm, it causes restlessness.\" The upward movement of the worms results in this feeling of agitation. \"When food is ingested, it leads to vomiting,\" because \"the worms sense the smell of food and will cause the person to vomit them.\" For \"Xian Jue,\" the Wu Mei Wan (Black Plum Pill) is the primary treatment, which also addresses prolonged diarrhea. In fact, patients who develop \"Xian Jue\" often have a stomach that is too cold; when the stomach is excessively cold, it is prone to the growth of worms. This is why it is classified under the \"Jue Yin\" syndrome. The coldness in the stomach is related to the liver; the liver is the organ responsible for detoxification. The toxins in the body are eliminated by the liver, but if the liver is cold, its detoxification function is not very strong. When it enters the \"Jue Yin\" syndrome, many viruses can accumulate in the liver, and with the liver's detoxification function not operating normally, it becomes easy for worms to grow in the stomach. The temperature of the worms aligns with the human body temperature; when a person eats, the worms also consume food. When the stomach is cold and does not receive food, the worms inside suffer from hunger and cold. When the worms are hungry, they tend to move upwards, which causes the patient to feel very restless. White spots can be observed on the patient's lips, and the patient may also experience abdominal pain. Generally speaking, abdominal pain indicates internal cold. In cases of internal cold, Xiao Jian Zhong Tang (Minor Construct the Middle Decoction) should be used with a heavier dose of Shao Yao (Peony Root), which is twice the amount of Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig). In cases of internal cold, the pulse should be deep and tight.",

Normally, the peristalsis of the stomach coincides with the movement of the diaphragm, which the person does not consciously feel. During breathing, the diaphragm moves up and down; when inhaling, the diaphragm descends and presses against the stomach. If the diaphragm rebounds immediately upon inhalation, it will continuously affect the diaphragm, meaning that the cold and cool herbs have slowed down the peristalsis of the stomach.\n\nWhen the stomach is completely deficient, the most severe treatment is with \"Fu Ling Si Ni Tang\" (Poria Four Reversal Decoction). For a lighter approach, \"Li Zhong Tang\" (Regulating the Middle Decoction) can be used, and for an even lighter treatment, \"Wu Zhu Yu Tang\" (Evodia Decoction) is appropriate. \"Wu Zhu Yu Tang\" is used to treat \"stomach prolapse,\" while using \"Li Zhong Tang\" is already quite risky. \"Fu Ling Si Ni Tang\" is reserved for cases where the stomach can no longer process the five grains.\n\nThis section emphasizes that one should never assume that \"not eating\" is simply due to a blockage in the Yangming channel. If one cannot distinguish between cold and heat, administering cold and cool herbs may cause the patient to belch. Conversely, if consuming cold and cool herbs leads to belching, it indicates that the stomach is inherently cold and cool.",

This indicates the onset of \"gallbladder jaundice.\" Even if purged, the abdomen remains distended; this is primarily due to the slow pulse.\n\nYangming disease pertains to gastrointestinal issues. A \"slow pulse\" indicates that the stomach is deficient. If the pulse is rapid, it typically suggests inflammation within or obstruction in the intestines. If the pulse is rapid, one should inquire about bowel movements. If the response is affirmative and accompanied by diarrhea, it indicates the presence of deficient heat. \"Difficulty in achieving satiety\" means that even a small amount of food leads to a feeling of fullness. \"Slight agitation when full, dizziness, and difficulty in urination\" suggest the onset of \"gallbladder jaundice.\" The majority of these symptoms arise from insufficient digestive secretions from the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas, leading to poor digestion in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in a deficiency and coldness in the stomach.\n\n\"Slight agitation when full\" indicates that the contents in the stomach cannot be digested; the food remains distended in the stomach, causing a feeling of mild discomfort. Why does dizziness occur? After eating, nutrients are primarily supplied to the brain. If the stomach is deficient and cold, food cannot be digested, and there is no nutrient supply to the head, leading to symptoms of ischemia, hence the dizziness. When the digestive system is not functioning properly, urination will also be abnormal. \"Difficulty in urination\" does not necessarily refer to the quantity being too much or too little; it may involve frequent urination with small amounts or just a few drops. Poor digestion, due to spleen dysfunction, leads to an accumulation of dampness, which tends to descend. Generally, dampness settles in the lower jiao, causing abdominal distension. If there is excessive dampness causing obstruction, urination will naturally decrease. If urination is normal, it indicates that dampness has...",

          "english_text": "Generally speaking, dampness tends to settle in the lower jiao, causing abdominal fullness. If there is excessive dampness blocking the flow, urination will naturally decrease. If urination is normal, it indicates that the dampness is being expelled through the proper channels. The cause of deficiency and cold is excessive dampness within. When dampness is too heavy and accumulates internally, the entire body may appear yellow, which is referred to as \"jaundice.\" This occurs because the digestive system involves the secretions from the liver, spleen, and gallbladder for digestion. If the functions of the liver and spleen are impaired, the spleen, which governs dampness, will lead to an increase in dampness. When the functions are poor, it results in swelling. Although there may be fullness in the lower abdomen, if the dampness is expelled, the fullness should not persist. This abdominal fullness is due to the enlargement of the spleen, with dampness obstructing the interior. The pulse will become very slow, and if such swelling is present, the patient will definitely exhibit jaundice. It can even be said that a patient with jaundice must be suffering from internal dampness.\n\n#SECTION\n\n212. In \"Yangming Disease,\" the treatment should involve promoting sweating; however, if there is no sweating and the body feels as if insects are crawling beneath the skin, this is due to prolonged deficiency.\n\nIn Yangming disease, there should be significant sweating, which is not limited to sweating from the head but is systemic. Therefore, if there is systemic sweating without any apparent reason, it indicates Yangming disease; other conditions do not present with such sweating. Now, if there is no sweating, why is that? It is because there is internal deficiency, and the fluids of the gastrointestinal tract are depleted. \"If the body feels as if insects are crawling beneath the skin, this is due to prolonged deficiency.\" The fluids in the stomach should first reach the skin and then the exterior, but when fluids are insufficient, sweat may be produced in the sweat glands but does not escape through the pores, causing the sweat to remain just beneath the skin's surface, leading to itching. This type of itching prevents the return of the stomach's fluids, so \"Gui Zhi Tang plus Huang Qi\" can be used.\n\nWang Hu stated: \"For the 'Yangming' no-sweat syndrome, it is still advisable to use 'Ge Gen Tang' as the primary treatment.\"",

I often say that sometimes you only need to place two leaves in front of your eyes to no longer see Mount Tai. The reason is that Western medicine observes viruses under a microscope and sees many different types of viruses, leading them to think that treating by killing the viruses is the solution. However, after you kill the first generation of viruses, the next generation becomes stronger, and thus you need to use stronger antibiotics to kill them, resulting in a vicious cycle. Eventually, there will come a day when these viruses can no longer be killed, and once a patient is infected with such viruses and develops inflammation, it leads to death because there are no medicines left to treat them. \n\nFrom the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the appearance of the virus is not important; what matters is to expel all of them, driving the viruses out regardless of their type, sweeping them all away. Western medicine is very formalized and lacks spirit; at first glance, they seem correct, but in reality, their treatment makes the condition worse because their methods are incorrect.\n\nFor \"Ge Jian Zhi Yin\" (Phlegm in the diaphragm), the patient experiences shortness of breath, fullness, a firm sensation below the heart, a dark complexion, and a pulse that is deep and tight.

Additionally, if the patient enjoys drinking cold beverages, the cold drinks or food consumed will cause cold dampness to block this area, while hot food will not.

          "english_text": "Deficiency and excess, supplementing the insufficient and reducing the excessive—this is its meaning. The excess is stored according to this principle. Following this reasoning, one must understand the concept of \"the superior physician treats the disease before it manifests,\" which is the original intent of Zhang Zhongjing. For example, when there is a problem with the liver, we should first strengthen the spleen; this is the most fundamental principle. We do not allow the liver disease to continue affecting the spleen, effectively confining the illness to the liver and preventing it from spreading further. This concept comes from Zhang Zhongjing's interpretation of the \"Neijing,\" which emphasizes that the highest level of Chinese medicine is to treat diseases before they manifest, while Western medicine focuses on treating existing diseases. \n\nIt is akin to a couple preparing for divorce; when they go to the lawyer's office to sign the papers, this is referred to as \"the disease has already set in.\" In reality, there were many symptoms prior to the divorce that indicated if the situation continued to worsen, they would inevitably face divorce. When symptoms are present, the lawyer (representing Western medicine) does not intervene; instead, Chinese medicine steps in. \"There are symptoms!\" Thus, we begin to take action. Chinese medicine is based on pattern differentiation and treatment, which is what is meant by treating diseases before they manifest. Waiting until one is already ill to begin treatment is too late!\n\nThe principles of the \"Neijing\" are broader than those of Western medicine, which is limited to localized issues within the organs. However, using Xiao Jian Zhong Tang as a method to treat liver issues by supplementing the spleen is not a principle; misapplication of this could lead to significant misjudgment of the condition. Xiao Jian Zhong Tang is only used for its sweet flavor to regulate the spleen and stomach, not to treat liver disease, because \"the liver's essence is inherently sour, while it contains bile which is bitter,\" and \"the stomach is fundamentally the source of blood production.\" I mentioned when introducing the \"Shang Han Lun\" that the source of blood is the spleen and stomach. After our intestines and stomach absorb food, \"the fluids of the liver and gallbladder seep into the stomach,\" where there are three components: the liver's sourness, the gallbladder's bitterness, and the spleen's sweetness.",

          "english_text": "This refers to the spleen and stomach. When our intestines and stomach absorb food, the \"liver and gallbladder fluids seep into the stomach.\" Inside the stomach, there are three components: the sourness from the liver, the bitterness from the gallbladder, and the sweetness from the spleen along with the mucus from the pancreas. If it is too cold, and our liver is affected by cold, we will vomit sour substances. Therefore, when experiencing sour vomiting, we use drying methods to stop the vomiting. If a patient is vomiting sour substances, it indicates that liver fluids are being expelled, and we treat this with Wu Zhu Yu Decoction. If there is liver heat, then bile will be vomited, resulting in a bitter taste. \"Teacher, why do I wake up in the morning with a bitter mouth?\" This is due to bile rising, which corresponds to the Xiao Chai Hu Decoction syndrome. You are all quite familiar with this now. If the bitterness is severe, we need to increase the dosage of Huang Qin in Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, and also increase the dosage of Ban Xia. Ban Xia can descend the rebellious qi and stop vomiting; in other words, when bile is rising, we need to use Ban Xia to bring it down. Thus, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction can harmonize the stomach qi. \"When dampness prevails, the liver and gallbladder are not in harmony.\" One of the most difficult concepts for people to understand in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is \"qi.\" What exactly is qi? Western medicine cannot see qi; it only observes the circulatory system, whether it is the lymphatic system or the blood circulation system. Western medicine does not recognize that it is qi that drives this circulatory system; its driving force is what TCM refers to as qi. If the qi of the liver and gallbladder is not sufficient, it means that the driving force of the liver and gallbladder is inadequate. The liver itself is the largest detoxifying organ in our body, and Western medicine acknowledges this as well. When we consume many substances, if liver function is not normal, the metabolic system will not function well, resulting in an inability to fully perform detoxification. In TCM, this condition is referred to as \"stagnation.\" Qi stagnation occurs in the liver, preventing it from moving properly.

          "english_text": "The concept here refers to a condition known as \"stagnation\" or \"depression\" (鬱). When Qi stagnates in the liver, the liver is unable to move properly. Under normal circumstances, our body circulates all the blood and residual toxins back to the liver, where they are detoxified before being released into the heart. However, when liver Qi stagnates for an extended period, it can cause food residues and toxins to accumulate, leading to the production of dampness. Once dampness is generated, patients may experience nausea. In fact, the stomach itself is not the issue; rather, it is the dampness stored in the liver that accumulates and exerts pressure on the stomach, resulting in nausea, which can lead to the expulsion of a significant amount of damp fluid. Sometimes, when brushing teeth in the morning, one may feel nauseous due to excessive internal dampness. Therefore, in general, if a patient experiences vomiting, it is mostly due to the presence of dampness within. As stated, \"When dampness prevails, the liver and gallbladder become unbalanced, leading to frequent vomiting.\"\n\nWhen dampness accumulates in the body for too long, the internal environment changes, making it very easy for parasites to develop. It is not necessary to ingest food with visible pests; even pork left unattended can develop parasites simply due to excessive dampness. Thus, if our digestive system is not functioning well, food will remain in the body for too long, and spoiled food can also lead to the growth of parasites. To nourish the liver, sour flavors are used, while bitter flavors assist in expelling. At this time, Wu Mei Wan (Black Plum Pill) can be utilized. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, there are bitter herbs such as Huang Lian (Coptis) and Huang Qin (Scutellaria), which are all cold and cooling in nature, primarily promoting downward movement and drainage. However, Wu Mei Wan, formulated by Zhang Zhongjing, does not employ bitter cold methods but rather utilizes a combination of bitter and warming properties. This is because warmth can transform dampness; only warmth can eliminate dampness. Therefore, Wu Mei Wan contains \"the sourness of Wu Mei (Black Plum), along with the warmth of Xi Xin (Asarum), Gan Jiang (Dried Ginger), Shu Jiao (Sichuan Pepper), Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig), and Fu Zi (Aconite).\"",

Licorice and red dates can generate body fluids and replenish them. Other treatments should be determined based on clinical evidence. Hysteria currently has no effective treatment in Western medicine for this hidden dryness.\n\nFor women who vomit saliva, if the physician purges them, it will lead to a feeling of fullness in the heart area. The first step is to treat the vomiting of saliva, for which Xiao Qing Long Tang (Minor Blue Dragon Decoction) is the main prescription. Once the salivation stops, then the treatment for the fullness can be addressed, for which Xie Xin Tang (Drain the Heart Decoction) is the main prescription.\n\nRegarding \"women who vomit saliva,\" the \"Nei Jing\" states: \"Saliva is vomited from the mouth when there is cold in the upper jiao.\" When a patient has cold in the upper jiao, they will salivate. At this time, warming herbs should be used, such as Ma Xing Gan Shi Tang (Ephedra, Apricot Kernel, Licorice, and Gypsum Decoction) or Da Jian Zhong Tang (Major Construct the Middle Decoction), employing warming and dispersing methods. However, if a physician mistakenly purges the patient, it can lead to fullness in the heart area, as the cold descends and settles below the stomach. Therefore, \"the first step is to treat the vomiting of saliva with Xiao Qing Long Tang,\" because the cold in the upper jiao causes salivation, and if the condition is attacked and purged, the cold will penetrate deeper.

Cold injures the meridians, causing hardness and stagnation above, resulting in vomiting of saliva and, over time, leading to lung atrophy and physical deterioration.

Dried ginger is warmer than fresh ginger; it warms the interior, while fresh ginger disperses cold. The use of fresh ginger aims to distribute the medicine throughout the limbs after ingestion, making it suitable for dispersing. If there is no fire left in the stomach, dried ginger is used to ignite the fire within the stomach, serving as a catalyst.

The blood pulse refers to Yin, while the string represents cold, indicating that there is water vapor obstructing it, which is why a string-like pulse can be felt. A weak pulse at the inch position (寸脈) indicates that the lung's Qi cannot expand, being constrained in this area due to the presence of cold. When the wrist pulse feels very thin and string-like, it indicates the presence of cold water, leading us to conclude that this person must have chest obstruction and pain. \"The reason for this is attributed to extreme deficiency,\" as this indicates that the patient is in a state of extreme internal deficiency, which causes this phenomenon. \n\nIf there is excess in the thoracic cavity, Traditional Chinese Medicine differentiates between heat excess and cold excess. If it is heat excess, it signifies that something is obstructing inside and has already become inflamed. In this case, Zhang Zhongjing prescribed the formula \"Da Xianxiong Tang\" (大陷胸湯) in the \"Shanghan Lun\" (傷寒論). If it is cold excess blocking inside, he prescribed \"Sanwu Xiaobai San\" (三物小白散). This section discusses \"deficiency\" syndrome, as \"excess\" has already been addressed in the earlier parts of the \"Shanghan Lun.\" \n\nWhy is it said to be \"attributed to extreme deficiency\"? This illness arises from a state of extreme Yang deficiency in the body, as the thoracic cavity governs Yang. We know that the disease is in the upper jiao, hence the chest obstruction and pain. The thoracic cavity is where Yang Qi gathers; it should be quite abundant. Therefore, in a normal person, the pulse at the inch position should be stronger, while the wrist pulse should be smaller and deeper, which is the normal condition. When the Qi of the lungs is depleted, we know that lung Qi has weakened, indicating lung deficiency, which means the upper jiao has become cold and deficient. \n\n\"Teacher, how do you know there is cold when there is deficiency?\" Because the wrist pulse is string-like, we know that there is cold inside. This first section describes how to use the pulse for diagnosis. \n\nA normal person without cold or heat, and with insufficient breath, indicates excess. \n\nWhat does \"a normal person without cold or heat\" mean?

          "english_text": "One section describes how to use pulse diagnosis. \n\nA person in a normal state has no cold or heat, and if they experience shortness of breath that is insufficient for breathing, this indicates a condition of excess. What does \"a person in a normal state has no cold or heat\" mean? It refers to a person who is normal and does not have any particular aversion to cold or heat, meaning there are no symptoms of cold or heat. Suddenly feeling as if one cannot breathe, along with \"insufficient for breathing,\" indicates very short breaths. From this point, we can determine that something is obstructing the flow, which signifies an excess condition. This is the method to differentiate between deficiency and excess. In the section on chest obstruction, we only introduce treatments for deficiency conditions, without addressing excess conditions.\n\nThe disease of chest obstruction includes symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, chest and back pain, and shortness of breath. The pulse at the cun position is deep and slow, while the guan position is tight and rapid. The prescription for this condition is Guo Lou Xie Bai Bai Jiu Tang (Bottle Gourd, Chinese Garlic, and White Wine Decoction).\n\nGuo Lou Xie Bai Bai Jiu Tang formula:\nOne piece of ripe bottle gourd, half a jin of Chinese garlic, and seven sheng of white wine. \n\nCombine these three ingredients, boil them together, and take two sheng, divided into warm doses for consumption.\n\nThis is a very light prescription. When the patient experiences \"chest and back pain,\" it means that sometimes the chest pain radiates to the back, and sometimes the back pain feels like it penetrates to the front of the chest. However, it is not as intense as heart pain that radiates through the back; it is merely a slight, dull ache. This is caused by the stagnation of Yang Qi in the chest, hence it is the lightest formula, Guo Lou Xie Bai Bai Jiu Tang. The ripe bottle gourd resembles a loofah; if you cut it horizontally in the middle, it looks similar to a tomato. This gourd is used medicinally, and you should cut it into sections from the middle. If we use its root, it is known as Guo Lou Gen, also called Tian Hua Fen. The ripe bottle gourd refers to using its fruit for medicinal purposes. When you go to the pharmacy to buy it, you might notice: \"Oh? Teacher, this looks like the heart's ventricles and atria.\" When viewed from the front, it appears this way, and there are seeds inside. If you observe it for three days...",

If you do not cook it for three days, upon peeling it open, you might see small white worms crawling out. This is not a problem; it indicates that there are no pesticides. If a medicine is stored in a cabinet for three years without any insects, then there is an issue with that medicine. It is like a glass of water that does not freeze even when taken to the North Pole—would you dare to drink it? If you did, wouldn't you be turning into an atomic bomb? Such water is undrinkable; medicines should naturally attract insects, which signifies that they are natural products. \n\nBecause it resembles a heart, it is used for symptoms like \"coughing, chest, and back pain,\" which includes coughing and wheezing, and can be treated with Trichosanthes fruit (Gua Lou Shi). The function of Gua Lou Shi itself is to eliminate phlegm and fluids, and it is very effective in dispelling dampness. It can also open the lungs and promote the flow of Yang Qi, as noted in herbal texts, indicating that it can open the heart and lungs, thus facilitating the flow of Yang Qi in the chest.\n\nWhy use Allium tuberosum (Xie Bai)?

By utilizing the properties of Xie Bai, we can eliminate this turbid Qi. After Xie Bai expels the turbid Qi, we still need a guiding herb, which is white liquor.

The reason the blood cannot descend is due to insufficient blood in the lower regions. Why do the lower limbs feel heavy? The blood in the veins of the lower limbs lacks the strength to return to the heart, which naturally causes a feeling of heaviness. This is all due to insufficient strength of the heart. In such cases, using Shao Yao Gan Cao Fu Zi Decoction can be effective. \n\nWhen there is \"pain in the heart accompanied by restlessness,\" this symptom arises from insufficient heart blood, causing pain within the heart and emotional agitation. This agitation is a type of vexation due to deficiency; when blood is insufficient, it can lead to dryness and heat, resulting in pronounced restlessness in the patient. \n\nAs for \"twitching at the navel,\" why does this occur? When the blood vessels and veins in the lower jiao cannot fully return to the heart, blood stagnates in the lower jiao and eventually presses against the navel. There is a major vein here that should flow back to the heart, and the most noticeable pulsation occurs here, indicating that the blood wants to return but can only reach the navel, after which it cannot fully ascend, thus it stagnates and begins to pulse. When you touch it, you can feel the vessel pulsing. \n\n\"The pulse is string-like, which is caused by heart injury.\" When our blood vessels are filled with blood, the pulse is robust and vigorous; now, the pulse has become thin and string-like, indicating blood deficiency and the presence of internal cold. Only those with deficiency and cold will exhibit this, which is a result of heart injury. \n\nIf you want to know if a person is naturally more melancholic, you don't need to see them in person; you can tell from their photograph. If the eyes are very close to the eyebrows, it indicates a person who is unable to let go of things, and such patients are the hardest to treat.

Your responsibility is to take care of your wife and children, do your job well, and manage your home. Daydreaming over there is of no use.\" Patients do not understand medicine; they spend a long time just thinking. If \"thinking\" could cure diseases, then it would be fine to think, but such thoughts not only do not help but also increase the burden on the physician during treatment.

In the process of treatment, we also need to address their emotional issues, which leads to more complications.

If you press harder, it becomes even more rapid, indicating a terminal condition with no hope for recovery; this is the true heart pulse. When we feel the true heart pulse, the heart itself governs a strong and forceful pulse, which is hard. We have introduced this concept in the \"Inner Canon\" (Neijing).",

A deficiency of blood and qi pertains to the heart; when the heart qi is deficient, the person experiences fear, closes their eyes wanting to sleep, dreams of distant journeys, and their spirit becomes scattered, leading to erratic behavior of the soul and spirit. A decline in yin qi results in mania, while a decline in yang qi leads to frenzy.\n\nThe so-called \"evil crying\" is when a person weeps without cause. Why does this phenomenon occur? In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), it is because the soul and spirit are unsettled. The soul is associated with the liver, while the spirit is associated with the lungs. The liver governs blood, the lungs govern qi, and the heart houses the spirit, which oversees both the soul and spirit—this is the pathology in TCM. If both the soul and spirit are unstable, the problem lies in the heart, indicating a deficiency in both heart qi and blood. \"A deficiency of blood and qi pertains to the heart\" means that the unrest of the soul and spirit originates from the heart. Our soul and spirit can remain stable primarily because the heart's blood supply to the liver and lungs is sufficient. \"When the heart qi is deficient, the person experiences fear and closes their eyes wanting to sleep\" indicates that when the spirit is not anchored, fear arises; the individual becomes fearful of everyone, as seen in patients with mental disorders, which TCM describes as a significant deficiency of heart qi. \"Closing the eyes wanting to sleep\" means that the eyes are shut, and there is a desire to sleep, yet they \"dream of distant journeys,\" which is exhausting; they are already fatigued, and now even in dreams, they must undertake long journeys, making them even more tired.\n\nIn TCM, it is said that \"the spirit cannot govern the soul.\" The soul itself is associated with stillness; when the soul loses its stillness, it will...",

The 69th entry refers to the sweating induced by Ma Huang Tang, which results in the loss of chest yang, leading to the sensation of heart palpitations below the heart. The 70th entry refers to excessive sweating from Gui Zhi Tang, which depletes the stomach and intestines of fluids, causing insufficient water. This leads to a sensation of pulsation around the navel area, preparing for the onset of \"ben tun\" (a type of abdominal discomfort). \n\nIn Traditional Chinese Medicine, heart palpitations below the heart are not observed as the heart racing clinically, but rather as a pulsation in the \"Zhong Wan\" area (the middle abdomen). This occurs because the yang energy above has dried up, causing the fluids to be drawn upwards, resulting in a blockage at the \"Zhong Wan\" area. At this time, \"Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang\" (Cinnamon Twig and Licorice Decoction) is used.\n\nIt is important to have a conceptual understanding: the area around the navel is associated with different organs— the center of the navel corresponds to the spleen, above the navel corresponds to the kidneys, below the navel corresponds to the heart, the left side of the navel corresponds to the liver, and the right side corresponds to the lungs. For example, if there is palpitations above the navel, treatment should focus on the kidneys, and similarly for other areas.\n\nGui Zhi Gan Cao Tang formula:\n- Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig) 4 liang (approximately 120 grams, peeled)\n- Gan Cao (Licorice) 2 liang (approximately 60 grams, roasted)\n\nCombine these two ingredients with 3 sheng (approximately 900 ml) of water, boil down to 1 sheng (approximately 300 ml), strain, and take it in one dose. \n\nIf using 4 qian (approximately 12 grams) of Gui Zhi, then use 2 qian (approximately 6 grams) of Gan Cao, as Gui Zhi is twice the amount of Gan Cao. This is because excessive sweating has occurred, and Gan Cao replenishes the stomach's fluids. \n\nWhy is only Gui Zhi used and not Bai Shao (White Peony)? Why does palpitations occur? When drinking water, the stomach is very hot, and when water enters the stomach, it vaporizes and becomes steam rather than remaining as water. If the water is stagnant in the \"Zhong Wan\" area, Gui Zhi, being very warming, will cause the water to evaporate upwards. Additionally, the outer membrane of the heart contains many nerves and blood vessels in the diaphragm; within the blood vessels is \"blood,\" and within the nerves...",

          "english_text": "Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig) promotes the evaporation of water upwards. Additionally, the outer membrane of the heart contains numerous nerve and blood vessels within the diaphragm and the vascular system, where \"blood\" circulates, and in the nervous and lymphatic systems, \"water\" is present. When Gui Zhi is administered, it enhances the heart's ejection force, rapidly vaporizing the \"water\" that has stagnated beneath the heart. Palpitations occur because the \"water vapor\" that should rise is instead \"water\" itself, which is cold, leading to palpitations. At this moment, the combination of Gui Zhi and Gan Cao (Licorice) quickly vaporizes the water and distributes it to the limbs, alleviating the symptoms. This is quite similar to the Xiao Qing Long Tang (Minor Blue Dragon Decoction) syndrome, where there is water vapor beneath the heart, which is always accompanied by cough and wheezing. However, this decoction does not present with cough symptoms, so Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang (Cinnamon Twig and Licorice Decoction) is used for palpitations beneath the heart. This is because excessive Yang energy leads to Yang deficiency, and palpitations resulting from Yang deficiency are treated with Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang. Gui Zhi can descend and counteract rebellious Qi, which is why it is heavily utilized here. Later, Gui Zhi Jia Gui Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction with Cinnamon) will also be employed to leverage Gui Zhi's ability to descend and counteract rebellious Qi.\n\nIf Gui Zhi and Gan Cao are further combined with Fu Ling (Poria) and Da Zao (Jujube), it enhances the treatment. When sweating occurs, it expels the fluids from the gastrointestinal tract, causing the water from the lower jiao (lower abdomen) to surge upwards, resulting in \"palpitations beneath the navel.\" The force of the rebellious Qi is strong, and this is primarily a water issue. When water is in the lower jiao, it relies on Fu Ling to expel the water, while Da Zao helps replenish the gastrointestinal fluids. Therefore, the seventy cases indicate that excessive consumption of Gui Zhi Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction) can lead to this phenomenon, which typically does not occur unless there is stagnation of fluids in the lower jiao, particularly in individuals with heavier water vapor accumulation in that area.\n\nIn the case of the sixty-nine instances, it has been observed that if Ma Huang Tang (Ephedra Decoction) is taken excessively, it can damage the fluids in the lungs, leading to palpitations beneath the heart.",

When the \"interior\" is in motion like a galloping horse, this formula is appropriate.\n\nThe Da Qing Long Tang (Major Blue Dragon Decoction) is essentially the Ma Xing Gan Shi Tang (Ephedra, Apricot Kernel, Licorice, and Gypsum Decoction) with the addition of three ingredients: cinnamon (Gui), ginger (Jiang), and jujube (Zao), thus transforming it into Da Qing Long Tang. Therefore, Da Qing Long Tang addresses exterior syndromes, using Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig) and Ma Huang (Ephedra) to release the exterior. Ma Huang is used at six qian (a traditional weight measurement). In addition to clearing internal heat, it also resolves the exterior. \n\nThe differentiation between Ma Xing Gan Shi Tang and Da Qing Long Tang is that both treat wheezing and heat. When asking the patient about their appetite, if the appetite is good, they should take Ma Xing Gan Shi Tang; if the appetite is poor, they should take Da Qing Long Tang, as ginger and jujube are appetite-stimulating herbs. When the medicine is ingested, why does sweating occur? It relies on the fluids from the gastrointestinal tract to induce sweating. If the stomach function is compromised, there will still be fluids for sweating, which is how this classification is made.\n\nTreatment of wheezing:\n1. Heat Wheezing: This occurs when the patient has significant spontaneous sweating, indicating Yang deficiency. The tongue coating is yellow, and when wheezing reaches the hands, it is mostly a deficiency syndrome, indicating prolonged wheezing. For children, use a single needle without retention; the sound of phlegm during breathing is loud. Only needle, no moxibustion, at points \"Gong Sun\" and \"Nei Guan\" (for stomach and heart), \"San Li\" and \"Tai Bai\" (Earth generates Metal), \"Lin Qi\" and \"Tai Bai\" (Jia and Ji harmonize with Earth), the frontal point \"Yun Men\" and the back point \"Fei Shu.\" Generally, patients with wheezing will have poor appetites, so also add \"Zhong Wan.\" The prescription will use variations of Da Qing Long Tang and Ma Xing Gan Shi Tang, depending on the appetite. If the patient enjoys drinking alcohol, use Gui Zhi Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction) with Hou Po (Magnolia Bark) and Xing Ren (Apricot Kernel).\n\n2. Cold Wheezing: The most commonly seen is cold wheezing. Every winter, patients cannot sleep and must sit up to sleep. The expectorated phlegm is white.

It refers to a face that appears shiny and smooth, without wrinkles. One might wonder, \"Is this person not using any oil? Why does their face look oily?\" This is what is meant by a \"young gentleman's face.\" The pattern of a young gentleman's face is not favorable; it lacks a solid foundation. The term \"thin complexion\" here is unrelated to the young gentleman's face; it indicates a deficiency of qi and blood in the body. \n\n\"Mainly thirsty\" means that the patient feels very thirsty. At this time, regardless of whether the thirst is caused by diabetes or some other condition, as long as the patient experiences thirst, it signifies a deficiency of body fluids. Why does a deficient person feel thirsty? Because the yin within is deficient, leading to an excess of yang. Some patients may be both deficient and hot, but this heat actually arises from yin deficiency, not from excess heat. If it were excess heat, we would need to use Bai Hu Tang or Cheng Qi Tang to attack it. However, the \"thirst due to deficient heat\" is different; if there is nothing to attack, how can we proceed? At this time, the deficient heat generated by the patient can still have a high temperature, which will also evaporate body fluids, causing thirst. \n\nIn such cases, we need to prescribe herbs to tonify the deficiency as well as herbs to clear heat. If we only prescribe herbs to clear excess heat, for example, if we administer Da Cheng Qi Tang, the heat may be eliminated, but the deficiency will worsen. Therefore, deficiency conditions must never be treated with aggressive methods. \n\nIf the patient has excess heat, meaning they have strong and robust heat, and you prescribe herbs to clear deficient heat, such as tonifying herbs, the excess will only become more pronounced. Traditional Chinese Medicine requires the ability to discern yin and yang, exterior and interior, deficiency and excess, cold and heat; it is simply about differentiating symptoms in this manner. \n\nSudden onset of \"wheezing and palpitations\" indicates that the patient is experiencing sudden shortness of breath, which signifies insufficient qi. Why does this happen? When a person...",

          "english_text": "Heat is simply diagnosed in this manner. When a patient suddenly experiences \"palpitations,\" it indicates a sudden onset of shortness of breath, which signifies insufficient Qi. Why does this happen? When the body is deficient, the function of the gastrointestinal system must be poor; the spleen cannot generate Metal (referring to the production of bodily fluids), and the fluids in the lungs are supplied by the pancreas and spleen. The spleen absorbs nutrients and then delivers them to the lungs. When the spleen's function is compromised, the patient will experience sudden shortness of breath, indicating a deficiency of Qi, which leads to this condition. Palpitations, in TCM, are also referred to as \"blood deficiency.\" Therefore, one is a deficiency of Qi, and the other is a deficiency of blood. Symptoms of palpitations indicate that the heart lacks sufficient strength, which leads to the sensation of palpitations, known in TCM as blood deficiency. The \"floating pulse\" is because the exterior of the pulse represents Qi; when you feel it, you are sensing the Qi pulse, not the blood pulse. Yang represents Qi, while blood represents Yin. When blood is insufficient, Yang rises to the surface, resulting in a pulse that feels large and floating; in reality, the patient is experiencing blood deficiency.\n\nFor men, a pulse that is weak, deep, and wiry, without signs of cold or heat, accompanied by shortness of breath and difficulty urinating, pale complexion, occasional eye closure, and a feeling of fullness in the lower abdomen, indicates a condition caused by overexertion.\n\nHere, several symptoms unique to overexertion are presented, and the practitioner categorizes them. If a man has a \"weak, deep, and wiry pulse,\" a weak pulse means that when you feel the pulse, there is a slight pulse, but when pressed harder, it disappears; this is called a weak pulse. Alternatively, the pulse may be very deep, only detectable near the bone, and disappears with heavier pressure. Or, the pulse may feel thin and string-like, which is also a weak pulse. In other words, the weak, deep, and wiry pulses all indicate a deficiency of both Qi and blood. The first situation is that the patient does not exhibit signs of cold or heat. When you ask them, \"Do you feel cold? Do you feel hot?\" they respond, \"No.\" \"Shortness of breath and difficulty breathing\" means that sometimes when the patient moves slightly...",

Do you feel hot?\" they respond, \"No.\" \"Shortness of breath and urgency\" indicates that the patient sometimes has difficulty breathing even with slight movement, and they often experience abdominal bloating and pain. \"Difficult urination\" refers to frequent urination with a small volume. \"Pale complexion\" indicates a sallow appearance. The patient often feels dizzy and may also experience \"epistaxis,\" which means they frequently have nosebleeds. Generally speaking, symptoms like difficult urination suggest that there is a problem with kidney function. A pale complexion indicates an issue with spleen function, as the color of the face is derived from the functioning of the spleen and stomach. Nosebleeds suggest that there is a problem with the liver itself. \n\nWhy do we discuss these symptoms? The main reason is to inform you that when such conditions arise, it indicates that the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys are all deficient. However, upon examination, the patient may appear to be quite normal, yet all five organs are simultaneously deficient, which is referred to as \"labor syndrome,\" or \"this is due to labor.\" These symptoms arise when there is a simultaneous deficiency in the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys.\n\nIn the case of \"labor syndrome,\" the pulse is floating and large, the hands and feet feel restless, symptoms are severe in spring and summer, and milder in autumn and winter. The deficiency of yin leads to the emergence of internal heat, causing soreness and weakness that makes movement difficult. \n\nFor patients with \"labor syndrome,\" when they become ill, their pulse is floating and large, accompanied by restlessness in the hands and feet. The restlessness is more pronounced in spring and summer, while it improves in autumn and winter. This is primarily because individuals with labor syndrome inherently have yin deficiency, which causes yang to rise. During the warmer spring and summer months, the internal deficiency heat interacts with the external heat from the environment, leading to discomfort for the patient. In winter, the situation improves because of the colder external temperatures.",

The 69th line refers to the use of Ma Huang Tang, where sweating has depleted the chest yang, leading to the sensation of heart palpitation below the heart. The 70th line refers to Gui Zhi Tang, where excessive sweating has depleted the gastrointestinal fluids, resulting in insufficient water. This causes a sensation of pulsation around the navel area, indicating a preparation for the condition known as \"Ben Tun\" (running piglet syndrome). \n\nIn Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the heart palpitation below the heart is not the same as the clinical observation of the heart racing; rather, it refers to the pulsation at the \"Zhong Wan\" area. This occurs because the heavenly yang above has dried up, causing the water to be forcibly drawn upwards, leading to a blockage at the \"Zhong Wan.\" At this time, Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang (Cinnamon Twig and Licorice Decoction) is used.\n\nIt is important to have a conceptual understanding: the area around the navel is associated with different organs— the center of the navel corresponds to the spleen, above the navel corresponds to the kidneys, below the navel corresponds to the heart, the left side of the navel corresponds to the liver, and the right side corresponds to the lungs. For example, if there is palpitations above the navel, treatment should focus on the kidneys, and similarly for other areas.\n\nGui Zhi Gan Cao Tang formula:\n- Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig) 4 liang (approximately 120 grams, peeled)\n- Gan Cao (Licorice) 2 liang (approximately 60 grams, roasted)\n\nCombine these two ingredients with 3 sheng (approximately 900 ml) of water, boil down to 1 sheng (approximately 300 ml), strain, and take it all at once. \n\nIf using 4 qian (approximately 12 grams) of Gui Zhi, then use 2 qian (approximately 6 grams) of Gan Cao, as Gui Zhi is twice the amount of Gan Cao. This is because excessive sweating has occurred, and Gan Cao replenishes the stomach's fluids. \n\nWhy use Gui Zhi and not Bai Shao (White Peony)? Why does palpitations occur? When drinking water, the stomach is very hot, and when the water enters the stomach, it vaporizes and becomes steam, not just water. If the water is stagnant at the \"Zhong Wan,\" Gui Zhi, being very warming, will cause the water to evaporate upwards. Additionally, the heart's outer membrane contains many nerves and blood vessels in the diaphragm; within the blood vessels is \"blood,\" and within the nerves...",

          "english_text": "Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig) promotes the evaporation of water upwards. Additionally, the outer membrane of the heart contains numerous nerve and blood vessels within the diaphragm and across the vascular system, where \"blood\" circulates, and in the nervous and lymphatic systems, \"water\" is present. When Gui Zhi is administered, it enhances the heart's ejection force, rapidly vaporizing the \"water\" that has stagnated beneath the heart. Palpitations occur because the \"water vapor\" that should rise is instead \"water\" itself, which is cold, leading to palpitations. At this moment, the combination of Gui Zhi and Gan Cao (Licorice) quickly vaporizes the water and distributes it to the limbs, alleviating the symptoms. This is quite similar to the Xiao Qing Long Tang (Minor Blue Dragon Decoction) syndrome, where there is water vapor beneath the heart, which is always accompanied by cough and wheezing. However, this decoction does not present with cough symptoms, so Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang (Cinnamon Twig and Licorice Decoction) is used for palpitations beneath the heart. This is because excessive Yang energy leads to Yang deficiency, and palpitations resulting from Yang deficiency are treated with Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang. Gui Zhi can descend and counteract rebellious Qi, which is why it is heavily utilized here. Later, we will also use Gui Zhi Jia Gui Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction with Additional Cinnamon), which also employs Gui Zhi's ability to descend rebellious Qi.\n\nIf Gui Zhi and Gan Cao are further combined with Fu Ling (Poria) and Da Zao (Jujube), it enhances the treatment. When sweating occurs, it expels the fluids from the stomach and intestines, causing the water from the lower jiao (lower abdomen) to surge upwards, resulting in \"palpitations beneath the navel.\" The force of the rebellious Qi is strong, indicating a water-related issue. When water is in the lower jiao, it relies on Fu Ling to help expel the water, while Da Zao replenishes the fluids in the stomach and intestines. Therefore, the seventy cases indicate that excessive consumption of Gui Zhi Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction) can lead to this phenomenon, which typically does not occur unless there is stagnation of fluids in the lower jiao, particularly in individuals with heavier water retention.\n\nIn the case of the sixty-nine instances, it has been observed that if Ma Huang Tang (Ephedra Decoction) is taken excessively, it can damage the fluids in the lungs, leading to palpitations beneath the heart.",

According to TCM theory, this condition can be classified as an invasion of Wind-Cold or Wind-Heat, accompanied by the influence of dampness. \\n\\nSyndrome Differentiation and Treatment: This patient is diagnosed with Wind-Cold or Wind-Heat type allergic rhinitis, and the treatment should focus on inducing sweating to release the exterior, dispelling Wind, and resolving dampness. \\n\\nPrescription: \\n1. Ephedra (Ma Huang) 3 liang (remove nodes) \\n2. Cinnamon Twig (Gui Zhi) 2 liang \\n3. Licorice (Gan Cao) 1 liang \\n4. Atractylodes (Bai Zhu) 4 liang \\n5. Apricot Kernel (Xing Ren) 70 pieces (remove skin and tip) \\n\\nDosage: Boil the above five herbs in 9 liters of water, first boiling the Ephedra, reducing to 2 liters, removing the foam, then adding the other herbs, continuing to boil until obtaining 2.5 liters, strain, and take warm in a dosage of 8 he (approximately 240 ml), inducing slight sweating. \\n\\nThis formula can be used for Wind-Cold or Wind-Heat type allergic rhinitis, effectively alleviating symptoms of sneezing, runny nose, and nasal congestion.",

A person with a strong constitution who develops a Ma Huang Tang syndrome may not receive an adequate dosage of Ma Huang Tang. However, Ma Huang Tang has already stimulated the circulation of blood and has activated part of the immune system. As a result, the Yang Qi surges upward, and the blood rushes upward, leading to dizziness and severe blood deviation from the meridians, causing nosebleeds. Sweat and blood share the same origin; sometimes, when a patient is given a sweating remedy, the fever subsides immediately after sweating. At other times, when a patient is given a sweating remedy, the result is a nosebleed, and the fever also subsides. Therefore, when children have a fever and experience a nosebleed, the fever may also resolve. Children have a strong Yang Qi, and sometimes when they catch a cold, a nosebleed can lead to the resolution of the fever. At this point, seeing the nosebleed indicates that the patient has recovered, and prescribing Ma Huang Tang again would be excessive.\n\nIn clinical practice, there is a case involving two carpenter brothers who, on a hot day, brought their father wrapped in a cotton quilt to the clinic, stating that he had suffered a stroke for a week. Upon examination, I determined it was a Ma Huang Tang syndrome and decided to use Ma Huang Tang, thinking that Zhang Zhongjing would not deceive me. To be cautious, I called the next day to verify, only to find out from the family that he was not at home; he had gone out to have fun. When I asked the family how many bowls of Ma Huang Tang he had consumed, they replied that he had only drunk one bowl. The effect of the medicine was that quick, and he still slept very well after taking Ma Huang Tang, without experiencing insomnia due to the Ma Huang. Although he had not improved after eight or nine days, regardless of whether the diagnosis was a stroke or a cold, as long as it was still a Ma Huang Tang syndrome, I would continue to use Ma Huang Tang. This exemplifies the principle of differentiation and treatment based on symptoms.",

In this case, Ma Huang Tang is not needed. It is commonly seen in children, especially boys who are very active, running around while their mothers are still preparing Ma Huang Tang. If the child has a nosebleed, it will resolve on its own, so there is no need to be overly anxious; the bleeding will stop by itself. This phenomenon generally occurs in children under the age of fourteen, as they possess a pure Yang constitution. Therefore, it has been mentioned in acupuncture courses that if children under fourteen experience a nosebleed, no treatment is necessary.\n\nThe body temperature may decrease due to the loss of blood from the nose, which is why Traditional Chinese Medicine refers to it as \"red sweat.\" Thus, individuals with a tendency to bleed easily may exhibit signs of cerebral congestion, which is not only harmless but can be beneficial.

          "english_text": "The situation is different. We also use the method of inducing sweating, and Zhang Zhongjing specifically emphasizes that inducing sweating requires great skill. If you induce too much sweat, the wind will be expelled, but the dampness will remain, because the patient does not only have wind symptoms. \"If the wind is gone but the dampness remains,\" then recovery will not occur. \"If treating wind-dampness, and the patient feels as if they are about to sweat, both wind and dampness will be eliminated.\" This patient feels as if they are about to break into a heavy sweat, but when you touch them, you find they have only produced a thin layer of sweat; this is the proper way to induce sweating. Therefore, the dosage in the prescription must be controlled very well. This is a standard principle in TCM for treating wind-dampness. In the past, everyone learned from the \"Shang Han Lun,\" which discusses purely exterior wind. Gui Zhi Tang is used to dispel wind; how should we handle patients with wind-dampness? Later, we will differentiate several conditions and use different prescriptions accordingly. Why must the prescriptions be differentiated? Because dampness appears in different locations, different prescriptions must be used.\n\nFor those with dampness, the body aches and feels feverish, the face is yellow and they experience shortness of breath, headaches, nasal congestion, and irritability.

Dampness in this area can lead to nasal congestion. Due to the sticky nature of dampness, it can block the nose, causing the patient to wheeze and struggle to breathe, resorting to mouth breathing. In this situation, we recognize that dampness is present in the nose, similar to what Western medicine refers to as sinusitis or nasal purulence, among other terms. \n\n\"Internal medicine will cure the nose.\" According to Zhong Shi, at this time, the medicine should be applied directly into the nose for the best effect. Since the patient's dampness is only accumulated in the nose, we only need to address the dampness there. If the medicine is taken orally, it will go to the stomach, which will delay treatment significantly compared to directly spraying the medicine into the nose. Therefore, when treating sinusitis, in addition to acupuncture, there is usually no need to use oral prescriptions; a nasal spray should be employed instead. \n\nIf we use acupuncture, we can select the Yingxiang point. If there is purulent discharge from the nose, with a lot of nasal mucus, we can perform moxibustion on the Shangxing point, which is also a major point for nasal conditions. Baihui and Qianding points can also be used to treat nasal diseases. Points on the back such as Fengchi and Feishu can also be used for nasal conditions, as the lungs open to the nose.\n\nWhen needling the Yingxiang points, if the nasal congestion does not clear immediately, it indicates that the needle has not reached the Yingxiang point.

          "english_text": "Cold-dampness, when it lingers on the surface of the skin, is treated with Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang (Ephedra and Atractylodes Decoction). \"Teacher, how can we determine if there is cold-dampness on the surface?\" This is indeed a question. Zhang Zhongjing mentioned, \"In cases of dampness, with body discomfort and pain, Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang can be used to induce sweating.\" This is because the patient already has dampness internally; typically, after sweating, the dampness can be resolved. When dampness is inside the body, there are usually no noticeable symptoms. However, once the patient presents with the symptoms of Ma Huang Tang (Ephedra Decoction), the cold constricts the exterior, leading to pain. The reason is that the dampness in the body cannot disperse through the skin's surface. This dampness originates from the lungs and reaches the skin's surface. When the skin's surface is affected by cold, it is essential to open the patient's pores to expel the cold, which must rely on Ma Huang Tang. Once Ma Huang Tang is administered, it will induce sweating. However, if the patient has significant dampness, as mentioned by Zhang Zhongjing, when sweating occurs, the wind may be expelled but the dampness remains, correct? Therefore, it is necessary to add Bai Zhu (Atractylodes) to the formula. Bai Zhu is effective in dispelling dampness, while Ma Huang Tang is used to expel exterior cold. If there is internal cold-dampness, this medication should not be relied upon, allowing everyone to distinguish between the conditions. Thus, if it is determined that the patient has exterior cold-dampness, there will definitely be a lack of sweating. When the patient already exhibits symptoms of Ma Huang Tang, we know that sweating is required. However, if you encounter a patient with Ma Huang Tang symptoms who has widespread joint pain and you also notice significant dampness, you should not simply prescribe Ma Huang Tang; you must add Bai Zhu to the formula. \n\nMa Huang Jia Zhu Tang is also indicated in cases of jaundice, when the skin appears yellow. In cases of yellow, dark yellow, or yin yellow, we also use Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang. Why is this? Because the damp-heat in the lungs is inherent to our body. When dampness is present in the upper jiao (the area of the lungs), the lungs themselves are the place where heat is expelled. When...",

Zhang Zhongjing stated that after drinking Chengqi Decoction, the patient may feel thirsty, but drinking some water will alleviate this. This differentiation explains that although it is clearly observed that the patient has diarrhea, one might mistakenly believe that there is no blockage inside. In reality, the patient experiences diarrhea due to an internal blockage, as the blockage is too severe.\n\nIn cases of febrile disease, when the intestines are dry and bowel movements are difficult, it is often resolved with decoctions. The stimulation and propulsion from the medicinal substances can indeed facilitate bowel movements, and water also assists in this process; for instance, drinking plenty of plain water can help with bowel movements. However, if pills are used, especially those made from pungent and hot ingredients, they only possess the power to stimulate intestinal peristalsis without the ability to moisten the intestinal walls. Therefore, the resulting excretion often contains a lot of residual moisture, which is why Western medicine or glycerin tablets cannot induce the production of body fluids in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n#SECTION\n\n119. \"Taiyang disease\" that does not resolve indicates a heat accumulation in the bladder, causing the person to appear delirious, with blood flowing downward; those who have this condition will improve. If the exterior has not resolved, it is not yet appropriate to attack; one should first resolve the exterior. Once the exterior is resolved, if there is still urgent distension in the lower abdomen, then it is appropriate to attack, and \"Taohua Hexing Decoction\" should be used.\n\n\"Taiyang disease not resolving\" means that there are still exterior symptoms of Taiyang disease, and the exterior heat has not dissipated. When Gui Zhi Decoction, Ge Gen Decoction, or Ma Huang Decoction fail to release the exterior, the virus directly enters the interior through the meridians, penetrating the bladder from the surface of the skin. The bladder is located at the front of the abdomen, with the Jingong (sacral area) in the middle and the large intestine at the back. Normally, the water that is excreted in urine is vaporized; during the vaporization process, some of the water moves into the gallbladder, where water generates wood and transforms into bile. The process of vaporization is inherently hot. When this heat enters the bladder, it transfers heat to the bladder, affecting the Taiyang bladder meridian. The heat then enters, and if it becomes too hot, the blood vessels may rupture, leading to urination.\n\n--- \n\nThis translation maintains the technical precision and medical terminology of the original text.",

Another scenario is when one gets kicked or suffers an injury during exercise in the area related to urination, leading to a blockage that prevents urination, causing internal blood stasis. This is also considered an external injury, and the formula \"Taohe Chengqi Decoction\" is used. \n\nHeat accumulation in the bladder manifests as excessively hot urine with blood. \"Taohe Chengqi Decoction\" is the first formula for treating blood conditions and is a relatively simple prescription. \"The person appears manic\" does not mean they are truly insane; rather, they are experiencing significant agitation and restlessness.

This indicates that there is something obstructing internally. \"If the symptoms are contrary, it indicates internal excess; the formula 'Tiao Wei Cheng Qi Tang' should be used,\" prescribing a light dosage of Tiao Wei Cheng Qi Tang. If the patient presents with fever and their pulse is weak, it indicates that internal cold has taken hold, and 'Si Ni Tang' should be used to rescue them. If there is excess heat, the patient may also experience diarrhea, with the stool being watery, indicating that the actual feces are obstructed inside. If one is not careful, it may be mistaken for diarrhea. In this case, one should attack the obstruction; once cleared, the fluids will naturally return. Zhang Zhongjing stated that after taking Cheng Qi Tang, the patient will feel thirsty, and drinking some water will suffice. This differentiation illustrates that although it is evident the patient has diarrhea, one might mistakenly believe there is no obstruction internally, when in fact the diarrhea is due to significant internal blockage.\n\nIn cases of febrile disease, when the intestines are dry and bowel movements are obstructed, it is often resolved with decoctions. The stimulation and propulsion from the medicinal herbs can indeed facilitate bowel movements, and water also aids in this process; for instance, drinking plenty of plain water can help. However, if pills are used, especially those made from pungent and hot ingredients, they only stimulate intestinal peristalsis without providing the necessary moisture to the intestinal walls. Therefore, the resulting bowel movements often contain excessive residual water, which is why Western medications or glycerin tablets cannot induce the production of bodily fluids in the intestines and stomach.\n\nSection 119: \"Taiyang disease\" that does not resolve indicates a heat accumulation in the bladder, causing the person to appear delirious, with blood discharging downward; those who discharge will recover. If the exterior has not resolved, it is not yet appropriate to attack; one should first resolve the exterior. Once the exterior is resolved, if there is still urgent distension in the lower abdomen, then one may attack it, and 'Tao He Cheng Qi Tang' is advisable.\n\n\"Taiyang disease not resolving\" means that there are still exterior symptoms of Taiyang disease, with exterior heat not yet dissipated. When Gui Zhi Tang, Ge Gen Tang, or Ma Huang Tang fail to release the exterior, the virus directly enters the interior organs from the meridians, penetrating directly into the bladder from the surface of the skin.",

          "english_text": "If there is exterior heat that has not resolved, when using Gui Zhi Tang, Ge Gen Tang, or Ma Huang Tang to release the exterior, the pathogen does not get expelled. Instead, this virus directly enters the interior through the meridians and penetrates the bladder from the surface of the skin. The bladder is located at the front of the abdomen, with the Jing Gong (the essence palace) in the middle and the large intestine behind it. Normally, the urine that is excreted is vaporized; during the vaporization process, some of the fluid moves into the gallbladder, where water generates wood and transforms into bile. The process of vaporization is inherently hot. When this heat enters the bladder, it transfers heat to the bladder, which is governed by the Foot Taiyang Bladder Meridian. The meridian connects to the bladder, and if the heat continues to accumulate, it can become excessively hot, causing blood vessels to rupture, leading to hematuria (blood in urine). This is a phenomenon where an external condition that has not resolved transmits to the interior.\n\nAnother scenario involves trauma, such as being kicked or injured during exercise, which affects the area related to urination, resulting in urinary obstruction and internal blood stasis. This is also a type of external injury, for which Tao He Cheng Qi Tang is indicated. Heat accumulation in the bladder manifests as excessively hot urine and hematuria. Tao He Cheng Qi Tang is the primary formula for treating blood conditions and is a relatively simple formula. \n\n\"When the person appears manic,\" it does not mean they are truly insane; rather, they are experiencing significant agitation and restlessness. If they were truly insane, it would be too late for Tao He Cheng Qi Tang to be effective, so this state is close to mania but not yet fully manic. \"Blood flows downward; when it flows down, it resolves.\" If at this time the urine naturally contains blood, it is not a concern, as the blood has been cleared. \n\n\"For those whose exterior condition has not resolved, it is not yet appropriate to attack; one should first resolve the exterior.\" To resolve the exterior, Xiao Chai Hu Tang is used, as it must pass through the middle jiao (the three burners) when addressing issues related to the \"fu\" (the viscera). \n\n\"Once the exterior is resolved, but there is still urgent distension in the lower abdomen,\" the lower abdomen refers to the area around \"Zhong Ji\" and \"Guan Yuan,\" which feels very tight.

They may also have difficulty urinating, and the skin appears very tense, with overall cramping. From these symptoms, it can be determined that there is blood stagnation in the bladder, preventing the blood from descending.\n\nStagnant blood refers to blood that has exited the blood vessels and lost its functional properties, becoming what is known in medical terminology as \"stagnant blood.\" Physiologically, stagnant blood not only loses its function but can also harm the entire body. It can transform into toxic substances, stimulating the brain's nerves and causing confusion, or lead to unclean blood, resulting in various pathological changes such as skin diseases, sores, tidal fever, as well as aggressive and migratory pain conditions. All acute and chronic diseases, as well as strange and unusual ailments, that do not improve over time in clinical practice are likely associated with stagnant blood. We have many methods to teach how to identify and determine the presence of blood stagnation. \n\nMedicinal formulas such as Taohua Chengqi Decoction, Xie Yuxue Decoction, Diding Wan Decoction, Guizhi Fuling Wan, and Dahuang Chanchong Wan are all effective remedies for treating stagnant blood. Guizhi Fuling Wan is specifically used for women with uterine fibroids or ovarian tumors. Dahuang Chanchong Wan is used when there is stagnant blood in the abdominal cavity, while Xie Yuxue Decoction is applied when there is stagnant blood causing internal injuries in the thoracic cavity.\n\nIn clinical practice, when encountering lower abdominal pain, remember to first inquire about the normalcy of urination. For example, if a woman comes to you for treatment of abdominal pain during her menstrual period and you forget to ask about her urination, you might mistakenly assume the pain is caused by menstruation. In reality, it could be due to bladder stones causing abdominal pain during that time, leading to an incorrect prescription.\n\nTaohua Chengqi Decoction formula:\n- 50 pieces of peach kernel (peeled and pointed)\n- 2 taels of cinnamon twig\n- 4 taels of rhubarb\n- 2 taels of Glauber's salt\n- 2 taels of licorice (prepared)",

One is when there is pain in the lower abdomen and frequent urination; the other is when the abdomen is not distended, yet the person feels fullness. For urgent cases, use decoction; for less urgent cases, use pills.\" Difficulty in urination indicates blood stasis in the bladder, which corresponds to the Peach Kernel Chengqi Decoction. Frequent urination corresponds to the Didao Decoction. Additionally, if the abdomen feels soft to the touch and the patient feels discomfort in the abdomen, this is also a blood condition. For urgent cases, use decoctions; for less urgent cases, use pills. Generally speaking, if the condition is superficial, the pain will be very acute; if the condition is deeper, the pain will be less urgent. Therefore, pills are used. Why use pills? Pills are characterized by their \"gentle and focused medicinal power.\" For \"acute conditions,\" they need to be expelled quickly, so decoctions are used; decoctions are for flushing out. For gastrointestinal issues, powdered medicines are more effective.\n\nThe \"Fang Yu Nao\" states: \"In cases of upper syndrome, those with a weak constitution often suffer. A weak constitution, even with blood stasis in the lower abdomen, should not be attacked. However, if not attacked, the illness will not resolve. Well said! Chen Ziming modified this formula by removing 'rhubarb' and adding 'rehmannia,' naming it 'Tongjing Pills.' With just this one modification, it effectively balances the need to attack and defend. The military strategies of Sun Wu are not sufficient to surpass this. I have used these four ingredients, decocted in water, to treat 'dry blood labor' with great efficacy.\" \"Dry blood labor\" refers to blood that has dried up in the abdominal cavity. The patient's external symptoms include \"skin peeling,\" which is often seen in girls, particularly on the legs and abdomen, and occurs every winter when the skin sheds.",

This condition is essentially \"dry blood deficiency.\"\n\n139. \"Taiyang disease\" manifests as jaundice, with a deep and tight pulse, hardness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, indicating a lack of blood. If urination is smooth, the person may appear manic, which is a sign of blood stasis; \"Dingdang Decoction\" is indicated for this.\n\nThis can be further divided into two categories: one with smooth urination and one with difficulty in urination, to differentiate between blood presence and absence. If there is no blood, the symptoms include jaundice, a deep and tight pulse, hardness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, indicating a lack of blood. In such cases, \"Yinchenhao Decoction\" will be used. Yinchenhao Decoction specifically targets heat in the bladder. When heat burns below, after the bladder has been vaporized, some unhealthy urine is expelled while some good fluids enter the gallbladder, secreting bile to aid digestion. Bile is yellow; if there is excessive heat in the bladder, the secretion of bile becomes too heated, leading to jaundice in the patient. One should not underestimate blood stasis; it may not be visible on X-rays, yet it can lead to manic behavior. This stasis can sometimes affect the brain. Depending on the situation, one might use \"Dachengqi Decoction\" or \"Dingdang Decoction,\" so it is essential to observe the urination patterns. If urination is smooth, \"Dingdang Decoction\" is appropriate; if the urine is very yellow, it indicates excessive heat in the lower jiao, and if there is constipation, \"Dachengqi Decoction\" should be used to purge.\n\n140.

If blood is not expelled, take more. The peach kernels are very sticky, and the crushed leeches are also sticky, so divide them into four pills. Generally, 20 leeches weigh about 2 qian, 25 fly larvae are approximately 2.5 qian, 20 peach kernels weigh 2 qian, and 3 qian of rhubarb. \"Jue Shi\" refers to the time after taking the medicine today; at least 24 hours should pass before checking for blood.

          "english_text": "In the context of blood's original color, the reason is due to insufficient fluids; at this time, eating water pears is best. \"When Yang is excessive, it leads to nosebleeds.\" Yang energy rises, and if the patient experiences a nosebleed, the heat within the blood will disperse, leading to improvement. If the patient has \"Yin deficiency with difficulty urinating,\" it is because the body lacks fluids. \"When both Yin and Yang are deficient, the body becomes dry.\" If the patient has deficiencies in both Yin and Yang, the body will become dry and emaciated. However, why does sweating occur only on the head? The body may not sweat at all, but the head is sweating profusely; this phenomenon is referred to in TCM as \"floating Yang.\" Floating Yang relates to the immune system and the function of the gastrointestinal tract, as well as the heat within the gastrointestinal system. Under normal circumstances, Yin and Yang intersect. Why can Yang heat remain in the middle jiao without dispersing? This is because a person possesses both Yin and Yang, as well as fluids, existing in a certain ratio, allowing it to remain in the middle jiao. If one day the fluids decrease, the reason for the decrease may be due to being attacked or scorched by fire. When fluids are insufficient, the Yang heat in the stomach rushes to the head, causing sweating. In herbal medicine, the best remedy to lower floating Yang is the shell of the oyster, which can gather floating Yang. According to the classic texts, a person with a \"steamer head\" can only serve as a school official and cannot be a military officer, as this person is too impatient. \n\nIn another scenario, Yangming heat can also easily cause sweating on the head, which is different from the previous case of \"only sweating on the head,\" as this occurs when both Yin and Yang are deficient. \"Abdominal fullness\" indicates that the stool inside has become dry. \"Slight wheezing, dry mouth, and sore throat\" indicate that the throat has become ulcerated. \"Or no bowel movement; if prolonged, it leads to delirium, and in severe cases, to hiccups.\" When hiccups occur, it signifies that the stomach Qi is exhausted, which is very dangerous. If this continues, \"the hands and feet become restless, fiddling with clothes and touching the bed. If there is slight urination...\"",

          "english_text": "When experiencing hiccups, one feels even weaker. The occurrence of hiccups indicates that the stomach qi is exhausted, which is very dangerous. If one also exhibits symptoms of \"hands and feet restlessness, fidgeting with clothes and touching the bed,\" it means that the stool is completely dry in the intestines. If urination is still smooth, it indicates that the original yang is still present, as urination is a manifestation of qi transformation, suggesting that body fluids are still available. However, if urination has ceased, it is truly perilous.\n\nFor example, in the case of a child with a cold presenting with a Ma Huang Decoction syndrome, if one dose causes excessive sweating and the fever subsides, it may shift to a Bai Hu Decoction syndrome. If misdiagnosed and the child continues to have a fever, administering Da Qing Long Decoction may occur. The child continues to sweat, indicating a Tai Yang exterior syndrome, which can quickly transform into a Yang Ming dryness syndrome. The act of fidgeting with clothes and touching the bed signifies that body fluids are depleted. In the case of Yang Ming dryness-heat syndrome, it is difficult to accurately assess the pulse of a child, as their pulse is typically rapid even in normal conditions. If the abdomen resists palpation, it indicates that the stool is obstructed inside. Should one consider Da Cheng Qi Decoction or Bai Hu Decoction for Yang Ming syndrome? Ultimately, due to the resistance to palpation, Da Cheng Qi Decoction is used. Once administered, the fever subsides. Additionally, this child has had jaundice since a young age, poor bowel movements, frequent Yang Ming dryness-heat, persistent thirst, and constipation, with slow cognitive responses. A single attack with Da Cheng Qi Decoction resolves these issues.\n\nXun Zhai stated: \"This section should use medication according to the syndrome. For 'jaundice disease,' use Yin Chen Hao Decoction; for abdominal fullness with shortness of breath, delirium, and constipation, use Cheng Qi Decoction. The unique symptom of restlessness and fidgeting is a manifestation of near-exhaustion of the spirit, and the principle is not to treat it.\" This phenomenon can be addressed with Da Cheng Qi Decoction. If the Bai Hu Decoction syndrome causes severe heat, using Xi Jiao Di Huang Decoction may be beneficial, but if there is constipation, it will not improve.",

In cases of \"cold damage,\" with a floating pulse, if the physician uses fire to forcefully expel it, and there is \"loss of yang,\" the patient will inevitably exhibit agitation and restlessness, unable to lie down or sit still. In such cases, the prescription \"Guizhi Decoction minus Shaoyao, plus Shuqiqi, Longgu, and Muli to Rescue Reversal Decoction\" is indicated.\n\nThe first formula for internal use in treating burns is \"Guizhi Decoction minus Shaoyao, plus Shuqiqi, Longgu, and Muli to Rescue Reversal Decoction.\" We can prepare this decoction on-site during a fire to help those affected. When burns occur, the skin can be charred in patches, sometimes even cracking open, with large, painful blisters. Patients may become agitated and delirious due to the shock of the fire, as fluids rush to the surface of the skin, causing pain and preventing sleep, leading to restlessness and irritability. Zhang Zhongjing wrote about \"Rescue Reversal\" for emergency situations, as the floating pulse indicates that the disease is on the surface. When fire ignites, fluids rush to the skin's surface without transforming into sweat, resulting in a significant amount of fluid accumulating on the skin. When one takes a dose of \"Guizhi Decoction minus Shaoyao, plus Shuqiqi, Longgu, and Muli to Rescue Reversal Decoction,\" within about an hour, as the medicine disperses to the skin's surface, the pain will significantly decrease. Since this is a \"Rescue Reversal\" formula, it is crucial to quickly deliver the medicine to the skin's surface. Therefore, Shaoyao is removed from the Guizhi Decoction; Shaoyao has a sour and astringent nature, which is more constrictive. If Shaoyao were included, the medicinal properties would not be able to reach the skin's surface quickly. Once the medicine reaches the skin's surface, Shuqiqi is added. Shuqiqi, also known as Changshan Miao, helps to eliminate phlegm. Normally, bodily fluids are contained within the gastrointestinal tract, but when exposed to intense heat, some of these fluids rush to the skin's surface, leading to the rapid formation of blisters due to the speed of this process.",

Once pathogenic factors enter the chest, the movement of water within the chest will not function normally, and a significant amount of energy will be expended to resist this. Consequently, it naturally becomes blocked, leading to symptoms such as nausea and vomiting in the patient. Therefore, whenever a patient exhibits vomiting, one should immediately consider the Shaoyang. Why does vomiting occur? When the water pathways are not functioning properly, the stomach cannot absorb nutrients effectively, preventing them from entering the Sanjiao and the internal organs. As stated in the \"Neijing\": \"The Sanjiao is the pathway for water, the official for drainage.\" Thus, the Sanjiao serves as the transport system. In this situation, old food remains undigested because the Sanjiao is afflicted by pathogenic factors, preventing the generation of new blood. Additionally, newly ingested food is not being processed and remains stagnant in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in nausea. These symptoms are all primary manifestations of Shaoyang in the Sanjiao.\n\n#SECTION\n\n278. \"Shaoyang Wind\": When both ears are unresponsive, the eyes are red, and there is fullness and agitation in the chest, one must not induce vomiting or diarrhea; doing so will lead to palpitations and agitation.\n\nIf it is Shaoyang, it also has symptoms of Taiyang. Initially, when one contracts a wind invasion, it presents as a Taiyang condition. At the same time, the Yang Qi in the gastrointestinal tract, which represents the immune system and the ability to maintain the exterior, expends part of its energy to resist the exterior pathogenic factors, leading to sweating. The fluids to combat the exterior pathogens are insufficient. Under these conditions, the original illness has not resolved, and it has progressed into Shaoyang, indicating that the fluids have already been damaged. When the fluids in the gastrointestinal tract are expelled to resist the exterior pathogens during the Taiyang condition, the illness transitions into Shaoyang because it could not withstand the attack. Therefore, the sweating method is employed to strengthen the immune system in the context of insufficient fluids.",

Therefore, the sweating method is used to strengthen the immune system. When there is a deficiency of body fluids, at this time, one may experience \"both ears hearing nothing,\" as the ears rely on body fluids for moisture. \"Red eyes\" occur because the eyes are nourished by blood; when there is insufficient water in the blood, the blood becomes heated, leading to inflammation, which first manifests as redness, swelling, and pain in the eyes. \n\n\"Fullness and restlessness in the chest\" indicates that the individual has already been affected by the pathogen. In cases of fullness in the chest, it is generally understood that the illness resides in the upper jiao, and the typical treatment would be to induce vomiting. However, if the physician mistakenly uses the vomiting method, it is inappropriate because the condition is not due to a blockage; rather, there is already a deficiency of body fluids. Inducing vomiting excessively can harm the qi, which refers to damaging the source of body fluids, as a significant amount of mucus and food will be expelled. \n\nWhen purging, it can harm the blood because blood is generated from the digestion of food in the small intestine. Ideally, food should be transformed into blood to nourish the body, but if it is eliminated before this transformation occurs, it can lead to blood deficiency. When the patient's vital energy is compromised, it results in a state of internal deficiency, which can manifest in two patterns: \"Xiao Jian Zhong Tang syndrome\" and \"Zhi Gan Cao Tang syndrome.\" If there are palpitations, it indicates damage to the upper jiao, corresponding to \"Zhi Gan Cao Tang syndrome.\" \n\n\"Vomiting and purging lead to palpitations and fright.\" The heart and small intestine are interrelated; the heart is the sovereign organ. When there is insufficient heart blood, the patient is more susceptible to fright. In such cases, \"Chai Hu Jia Long Gu Mu Li Tang\" is administered to address the fright. If there are palpitations, in addition to the phenomenon of palpitations, the pulse may also show a knotted or intermittent quality. Fright can be observed in the patient’s glabella and the root of the nose, which may appear purplish. In pediatrics, one may observe that a child's stool has turned green, and there may be blood behind the ears resembling chicken feet.",

Therefore, excessive vomiting can injure the blood, as the source of nourishment is lost. The patient will feel restless due to insufficient blood, as the heart governs blood. With the stomach emptied, the fluids within the stomach are also insufficient, resulting in the patient experiencing 'hardness below the heart.' If pressure is applied to the stomach and a hard mass is felt, it indicates retained food; if it feels soft and pliable, it means there is nothing inside, and the stomach wall has adhered together. 'Pain below the ribs, qi rushing up to the throat' occurs because the vomiting and diarrhea have caused injury; the stomach qi, which should descend, is instead rising, as food enters the stomach, is ground down, and then moves into the small intestine.\"",

The stomach qi, which should normally descend, is affected; food enters the stomach, is ground up, and then moves into the small intestine and subsequently the large intestine, with the food moving downward. The stomach's peristaltic movement is directed downward. However, due to excessive vomiting, the stomach qi rises.

If sweating is induced under these conditions, the water content in the blood decreases further, causing more harm. Once the water content in the blood is insufficient, the patient may exhibit high fever, resulting in a weak pulse.

Xuanfu Hua and Dai Zhe Shi are TCM herbs used to eliminate heat and phlegm. Sweating, vomiting, and purging have not removed the phlegm, which remains stuck in the middle. This \"reversed qi\" differs from the \"reversed qi\" in Gan Cao Xie Xin Decoction, which is purely due to deficiency. Xuanfu Dai Zhe Shi Decoction contains phlegm and fluid, using Xuanfu Hua to soften and dissolve the hardened phlegm, and Dai Zhe Shi to descend the rebellious qi and stop the reversed qi. \n\nXuanfu Dai Zhe Shi Decoction is used for patients who often feel nauseous and have phlegm that cannot be expelled, along with a deficiency in the stomach. The symptoms of acid reflux and heartburn can often be resolved with just one dose of Xuanfu Dai Zhe Shi Decoction. The cause is often excessive consumption of refined sugars in sweet foods, so after prescribing the decoction, it is also necessary to advise the patient to completely avoid sweet foods made from refined sugars.\n\nAccording to \"Canying Guan Zhiliao Zahua\": \"Zhou Yangjun said: 'For treating reversed stomach qi and qi that does not descend, this has miraculous effects.' This refers to cases where 'Sheng Jiang Xie Xin Decoction' has been used but the reversed qi remains, indicating a deficiency of qi that is rebellious, and this formula should be used to suppress it.\" Xuanfu Dai Zhe Shi Decoction is used in classical formulas to suppress rebellious qi. At this time, the feeling of nausea and reversed stomach qi is very strong; relying solely on Ban Xia (Pinellia) cannot stop the vomiting, so Xuanfu Hua and Dai Zhe Shi must be used. Ban Xia is most effective for \"water vomiting,\" but its power is insufficient for \"phlegm vomiting,\" hence the need for Xuanfu Hua and Dai Zhe Shi.\n\nDifferentiation of \"Jie Xiong\" (Chest Bind) syndrome, \"Pi\" syndrome, and similar syndromes: \n\"Cold Excess Jie Xiong\" refers to \"pus in the chest\" or \"lung abscess,\" and \"San Wu Xiao Bai San\" can eliminate pus and toxins. \"Jie Xiong syndrome\"",

Therefore, \"the first step is to treat the vomiting of saliva and foam with Xiao Qing Long Tang,\" as the cold in the upper jiao causes the vomiting of saliva and foam. If the condition is attacked and purged, the cold will penetrate deeper, so Xiao Qing Long Tang is used to disperse it. After taking Xiao Qing Long Tang, if the saliva and foam stop, then the treatment can return to addressing the fullness caused by the mistaken purging with Xie Xin Tang.\n\nIn women's diseases, due to deficiency and accumulation of cold and qi stagnation, the flow of water in the meridians is obstructed, leading to years of cold blood accumulation at the entrance of the womb. Cold injures the meridians, solidifying and condensing above, causing vomiting of saliva and phlegm, which can lead to chronic lung atrophy and physical deterioration. In the middle abdomen, there may be cold hernias around the navel, or pain in both sides, connected to the organs, or heat accumulation causing pain in the lower abdomen, with a rapid pulse and skin resembling fish scales. This condition can occur in men as well, not just in women. \n\nIn the lower abdomen, there may be irregular menstrual cycles, leading to painful pulling sensations in the yin, with a feeling of cold in the lower abdomen, or radiating pain to the waist and spine, with qi rushing and causing acute pain, as well as pain in the knees and shins, sudden dizziness, and symptoms resembling syncope. There may also be feelings of sorrow and excessive anger, all of which are...",

          "english_text": "Why does amenorrhea manifest in this way? Zhang Zhongjing stated that this condition is referred to as \"leukorrhea.\" For women's miscellaneous diseases, we have a unified term called \"leukorrhea.\" The reason for this is \"previous miscarriage.\" Women may have experienced a miscarriage in their youth, leading to \"stagnation of blood in the lower abdomen.\" Some women, after giving birth, may not have had their uterus completely cleared, resulting in residual blood inside, which causes the current symptoms of dryness in the lips and mouth. At this time, \"Wen Jing Tang\" (Warm the Meridians Decoction) should be used for treatment. This is because when women experience amenorrhea, the uterus will atrophy, and using large doses of aggressive herbs is not appropriate. When the uterus is atrophied, we often use Wen Jing Tang, as there is stagnant blood in the lower abdomen. Wen Jing Tang is specifically used for uterine cold due to deficiency, so it can be applied not only during menopause but also for irregular menstruation or when there is stagnant blood in the uterus that cannot be expelled. It can also be used for women who are infertile.\n\nWen Jing Tang has historically been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine as a prescription for seeking conception, so one can note beside Wen Jing Tang \"long-term blood cold,\" indicating that over the years, cold blood has accumulated at the entrance of the uterus and within the uterus itself. \"Cold\" refers to a lack of warmth, indicating hypoxia and stagnation, which is caused by blood clots accumulating in the uterus. Therefore, Wen Jing Tang is also a prescription for fertility. \n\nAs for Wu Zhu Yu (Evodia rutaecarpa), Zhang Zhongjing selected it because it enters the liver meridian, which can invigorate liver blood and facilitate its flow to the uterus. Dang Gui (Angelica sinensis), Chuan Xiong (Ligusticum chuanxiong), and Shao Yao (Paeonia lactiflora) are all blood tonics that can increase blood volume. Ren Shen (Ginseng), Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig), along with the later additions of Sheng Jiang (Fresh Ginger) and Gan Cao (Licorice), are all herbs that promote Yang energy, which can invigorate Yang Qi. When Yang Qi is abundant, blood will also circulate, making these herbs effective for both generating Yang and invigorating blood.",

This formula contains ingredients such as Tu Guo Gen, Shao Yao (Peony), Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig), and Chan Chong (Silkworm), among others. If Chan Chong is unavailable, it can be substituted with Tao Ren (Peach Kernel) or Hong Hua (Safflower). Additionally, we may include blood-activating and stasis-resolving herbs like San Leng (Sparganium) and E Zhu (Curcuma) that are commonly used in prescriptions. These herbs are all aimed at promoting menstruation. Generally, if menstruation does not occur normally, we need to invigorate the flow of menstruation, and this is achieved with Tu Guo Gen San. \n\nIf you wish to use Wen Jing Tang (Warm the Menses Decoction), the primary symptom of the patient is dry lips and a dry mouth, indicating internal blood deficiency. If the patient does not have blood deficiency, there is no need to use Wen Jing Tang; simply using Tu Guo Gen San to promote menstruation will suffice. Both Wen Jing Tang and Tu Guo Gen San are used to treat blood stasis in the uterus, but the difference is that one is for blood deficiency while the other is for sufficient blood. Wen Jing Tang is used when there is insufficient blood, which leads to dry mouth and tongue.\n\nThe pulse at the cun (radial) position is wiry and large; a wiry pulse indicates reduction, a large pulse indicates fullness, a reduced pulse indicates cold, and a hollow pulse indicates deficiency. Cold deficiency interacting with each other is termed \"ge.\" In women, this may lead to postpartum hemorrhage, while in men, it may result in blood loss and loss of essence.\n\nThis has been introduced previously. \n\nFor women experiencing amenorrhea with continuous dark bleeding, Jiao Jiang Tang (Ginger and Gelatin Decoction) is the main treatment. \n\nJiao Jiang Tang formula:\nJiao Ai Tang (Mugwort and Gelatin Decoction) plus dried ginger, as seen in \"Qian Jin Fang\" (Thousand Golden Prescriptions).\n\nWhat is meant by \"amenorrhea\"? It actually refers to blood collapse (excessive bleeding). Please note, \"amenorrhea is blood collapse.\" When a girl experiences blood collapse, it means there is a significant amount of bleeding, or it may be continuous dripping. Generally, menstruation lasts for five days, but if it continues for fifteen days without stopping, and there is continuous dripping, \"dark and unresolved\" refers to when the menstrual blood turns black. This indicates a lack of oxygen and insufficient Yang. Jiao Jiang Tang is essentially a modification of Jiao Ai Tang.",

          "english_text": "The prescription specifically introduces how to treat this condition. \n\nThe pulse at the cun (寸) position is string-like and large; a string-like pulse indicates deficiency, while a large pulse indicates a hollow quality. A deficient pulse suggests coldness, while a hollow pulse indicates emptiness. The interplay of cold and emptiness is termed \"ge\" (革). In women, this can lead to miscarriage, while in men, it can result in loss of blood and seminal fluid.\n\nWhen palpating the pulse, the fingertips press in the area between the cun and guan (關) positions, where the pulse fluctuates back and forth, jumping from one side to the other. How can we, in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), know that a woman is at risk of miscarriage? Because in a healthy individual, the blood from the heart flows down to the lower jiao (下焦) to nourish the fetus for its growth. The mother consumes food, which is digested by the spleen and stomach, and then passed to the lungs. The lungs, through the chong mai (衝脈), produce part of the breast milk and another part descends to the uterus, providing nourishment to the fetus. Additionally, blood from the liver also enters the uterus, contributing to the child's growth. Both of these pathways in TCM are sources of fetal blood.\n\nIf we palpate the pulse of a normal pregnant woman, it will flow continuously from the cun to the chi (尺) position. However, in the case of the patient, the pulse is jumping on both sides. The reason for the pulse jumping from side to side is due to internal deficiency and insufficient yin blood. When we have insufficient blood, there are two types of pulse symptoms: the first is weak and almost imperceptible, indicating imminent death, where the blood flow is about to cease, and at this point, the pulse is so small that it cannot even be felt. The second type has some blood remaining, but the patient's vitality is very strong; when you palpate the pulse, it feels more urgent because the internal organs are competing for blood, causing the pulse to run on both sides.\n\nWhen a pregnant woman is weak, the blood in the uterus will be insufficient. This blood is originally meant to nourish the fetus for its growth, but when it suddenly becomes depleted, it can lead to miscarriage and continuous bleeding. A menstrual cycle that should occur once a month may instead happen four times.",

          "english_text": "The fetus relies on blood for growth; when suddenly there is no blood, a miscarriage occurs, followed by continuous bleeding. A woman who is supposed to have her menstrual period once a month may experience it four or five times instead. Sometimes it lasts for three days and then stops, only to return shortly after, creating a continuous cycle.\n\nWhen a man encounters this type of pulse, it indicates \"loss of blood and essence,\" because a man's essence and blood share the same origin, just as a man's sweat and blood do. A man's essence is similar to a woman's breast milk, which is white. A woman's breast milk is transformed from nutrients by the heat of the heart before descending to the uterus to become blood. A man's essence is formed from nutrients by the heat of the small intestine, and both are white in color. The treatment for postpartum bleeding and miscarriage will be introduced later. How should a man handle the loss of blood and essence? One might use Gui Zhi Long Gu Mu Li Tang (Cinnamon Twig, Dragon Bone, and Oyster Decoction), but this only prevents the loss of essence. If the goal is to enhance vitality, Gui Zhi Long Gu Mu Li Tang is not as effective; we need to rely on formulas like Tian Xiong San (Heavenly Hero Powder) and similar ones.\n\nFor individuals who have lost blood, if they are induced to sweat, they may experience \"cold shivering and trembling.\" As I mentioned earlier, sweat and blood share the same origin in the human body. Therefore, those with bleeding disorders, blood loss, or skin ulcers should not be induced to sweat. Additionally, if a patient has numerous ulcers on their body, you should not induce sweating in them.\n\nA patient may present with fullness in the chest, dry lips, a bluish tongue, and a dry mouth, desiring to rinse with water but not wanting to swallow. There is no presence of cold or heat, the pulse is weak and large, and it comes late, with the abdomen not feeling full. The patient may express a feeling of fullness, indicating the presence of stagnant blood.\n\nThe phrase \"patient with chest fullness and dry lips\" marks the beginning of our discussion on the diagnostic principles of stagnant blood. How can we determine if there is stagnant blood in a patient's body? There are many causes of stagnant blood; some individuals may have residual substances in the uterus after childbirth, while others may have internal injuries or trauma.",

          "english_text": "Is there blood stasis in the body? There are many reasons for blood stasis. For some individuals, it may be due to retained lochia after childbirth that has not been completely expelled. For others, it may result from internal injuries or trauma. Various accidents can also lead to blood stasis within the body. There are several symptoms that can assist us in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in diagnosing whether a patient has blood stasis. \n\nThe first symptom is \"chest fullness,\" where the patient feels a sensation of fullness in the chest. The second symptom is \"dry and shriveled lips,\" where the lips are dry and appear smaller. Why is this the case? I will explain shortly, but first, let’s note a few important symptoms. The second symptom is \"blue tongue and dry mouth,\" indicating dryness in the mouth and a bluish color of the tongue. \n\nIn TCM, the concept is that \"the heart governs blood.\" Therefore, when there is blood stasis, the force of blood returning to the heart is insufficient, leading to the sensation of chest fullness in the patient. For instance, when we use Gui Zhi Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction), if we encounter a patient with chest fullness, we need to remove Bai Shao (White Peony Root) because individuals with heart conditions will experience chest fullness. \n\nAdditionally, the spleen governs transportation and transformation; it is associated with the earth element and is yellow in color. The spleen plays a crucial role in the transportation of nutrients within our body. During the process of blood production, if there is blood stasis blocking the flow, this stasis may be located in the stomach or intestines, but regardless, the presence of blood stasis indicates a problem with blood circulation. Consequently, normal blood cannot be transported to the limbs. The spleen opens to the mouth, so at this time, we may observe that the patient’s mouth is drier and more withered, lacking moisture. \n\nThe bluish color of the tongue is not uniform across the entire tongue but is typically observed on both sides of the tongue body. This is something I have observed clinically many times. Generally, when encountering individuals with internal injuries, extending the tongue reveals...",

Take one pill before meals each day, and if necessary, increase to three pills.\n\nLooking at this diagnostic criterion can be quite challenging to understand, so I will provide a brief explanation for clarity. This criterion essentially discusses how we differentiate whether a patient is pregnant or if there is a tumor in the uterus. \"Zheng\" refers to blood clots or similar tumors, indicating the presence of stagnant blood clots or tumors that have not been expelled. During pregnancy, menstruation should normally cease, which is expected. For instance, if menstruation is due on the 5th of the month and does not occur, how do we determine whether she is pregnant or has a pathological condition? We must first inquire about her menstrual history over the past three months. If her menstruation has been very regular during those three months, it is possible that she is pregnant. Conversely, if her menstruation has been irregular in the past three months, this does not necessarily indicate pregnancy. This is the first key point considered by Zhang Zhongjing.\n\nIf pregnancy is confirmed and by the third month there is abnormal bleeding, we must suspect the presence of a pathological condition. \"Women may have pathological conditions\" refers to the possibility that if a pregnant woman already has stagnant blood or a pathological condition in the uterus, most will experience abnormal bleeding by the third month of pregnancy. \"Fetal movement at the navel\" does not actually refer to true fetal movement; rather, it indicates that due to stagnant blood inside, there may be palpitations that feel like movement at the navel. This is not genuine fetal movement but rather a sign that there are pathological masses obstructing the growth of the fetus. \n\nIn summary, if menstruation is very regular in the first three months of pregnancy, but by the third month there is abnormal bleeding, and the blood is bright red...",

Simply put, if menstruation is normal during the first three months of pregnancy, but in the third month after conception there is continuous bleeding with bright red blood, it indicates that the woman is pregnant but is at risk of miscarriage, not due to any pathological condition causing the bleeding. If menstruation was already abnormal during the first three months, and then there is a continuous absence of menstruation for three months, it becomes unclear whether she has a pathological condition or is pregnant. If, after the third month, she experiences continuous dark bleeding, it indicates that there is a pathological condition in the uterus, not pregnancy. The practitioner wants to emphasize that it is crucial to confirm that the woman is not pregnant before prescribing medication; misdiagnosis could lead to a pregnant woman taking Gui Zhi Fu Ling Wan, which increases the risk of miscarriage. \n\nAs for the continuous bleeding, why does her menstruation not stop? It is because \"the pathology has not been resolved, hence the symptoms persist.\" Currently, in clinical practice, we find that Gui Zhi Fu Ling Wan is particularly effective for conditions such as uterine fibroids or ovarian tumors. I encountered a woman whose uterine fibroid was as large as a pomelo and felt very hard upon examination. Generally, women experience a decline in their menstrual cycle after the age of forty-nine, but this woman continued to have regular menstruation at the age of fifty-four. This lady is quite interesting; her perspective is unique. She had known about her uterine tumor for a long time, and despite the size of the fibroid, when advised by Western medicine to undergo surgery, she refused. She asked the doctor, \"Will this lead to death?\" The doctor replied, \"There is a slight chance, but it is not certain; perhaps one in a thousand.\" She said, \"I will take that one in a thousand chance; I do not want surgery.\" This woman is also very extraordinary.",

Originally, her menstrual cycle was very regular, but after she started taking Gui Zhi Fu Ling Wan, her menstruation continued without stopping. However, her energy was good, and she did not become weak; her abdomen began to shrink, and she was only taking Gui Zhi Fu Ling Wan without any additional special prescriptions. Therefore, for conditions like uterine fibroids and ovarian tumors, this formula can be used for girls with abdominal tumors, and surgery should be avoided initially. Sometimes, after surgery, if bleeding does not stop, Western medicine may only have the option to remove the entire uterus or the ovaries, which would prevent future pregnancies, leading to more complications, and sometimes even a loss of libido.\n\nSince the condition arises from blood stasis, Zhang Zhongjing employed both methods of breaking the mass and breaking the blood. The functions of Dan Pi (Moutan Root) and Tao Ren (Peach Kernel) are to invigorate blood and resolve stasis. Traditional Chinese Medicine theory posits that a man's essence palace and a woman's uterus are merely gaps within the lower jiao's oil network, rather than being classified as an organ or a viscera. This is considered a problem within the oil network of the three jiao, which is why Poria is included. Poria itself enters the three jiao and can facilitate the flow within this network. Gui Zhi is used because it can unblock the Chong Mai (Penetrating Vessel), allowing the blood from the upper jiao to descend. When the blood from the upper jiao descends, Poria transports this new blood into the uterus, and then Dan Pi and Tao Ren help to break up the old stagnant blood, effectively expelling the blood clots from within the uterine tumors. During this process, there may be concerns about abdominal cramping; at this time…\"",

At this time, we cannot treat the fetus's cold condition as an exterior symptom and induce sweating, because the fetus circulates together with the mother’s body. Therefore, it should be treated as an interior condition. When the illness is due to interior cold, we will use Fuzi Decoction. If we could ask the fetus at this moment, it would certainly say: \"Wow! My whole body hurts.\" The main symptom of Fuzi Decoction is generalized pain, with the skin feeling painful as if being whipped. Fuzi Decoction consists of five medicinal ingredients: Fuzi (Aconite), Fuling (Poria), Baizhu (Atractylodes), Renshen (Ginseng), and Shaoyao (Peony).\n\nThe master said: For women with abnormal vaginal discharge, those who have postpartum bleeding that does not cease, and those who experience bleeding during pregnancy, if there is abdominal pain during pregnancy due to obstruction of the fetus, Jiao Ai Decoction is indicated.\n\nJiao Ai Decoction:\nSix taels of dried Rehmannia, two taels each of Chuanxiong, Ejiao, and Licorice, three taels each of Mugwort and Angelica, and four taels of Peony. \n\nCombine these seven ingredients with five sheng of water and three sheng of clear wine, boil together, and take three sheng, removing the dregs.

It refers to menstrual bleeding that does not stop. Normally, menstruation lasts about five days; some may have it for four days or even three days, but now there are cases where menstruation continues for a month, which is not normal. Women’s complexion becomes dark, indicating severe abnormal discharge. The spleen is the organ that governs blood, while the liver is the organ that stores blood. If the spleen cannot transform and transport, and the liver does not store blood, then blood will leak out, indicating a deficiency of both the liver and spleen.

This condition is classified as a deficiency of both the liver and spleen. Sometimes, this can be caused by excessive drinking, heavy thinking, high work pressure, or feelings of loneliness at home, all of which can result in the deficiency of both the liver and spleen. Consequently, many young women may experience blood leakage. Those who have studied the pulse of leakage will recognize that the pulse is bounding on both sides in the area below the cun pulse and above the guan pulse, indicating that menstruation is excessively flowing.\n\nThe second condition is \"post-abortion continuous bleeding,\" where the patient experiences prolonged menstrual flow after a miscarriage. The third condition is \"bleeding during pregnancy,\" where there may be bleeding in the middle of pregnancy, or some individuals may experience continuous bleeding after giving birth. At this time, the patient's complexion appears dark, indicating significant blood loss.

In Jiao Ai Decoction, there is dried rehmannia, which nourishes the blood.

Therefore, dried rehmannia is actually used to nourish the liver and replenish blood.

Dang Gui nourishes the blood, while Shao Yao (peony) can both restrain and stop bleeding as well as alleviate abdominal pain. The most important components of Jiao Ai Decoction are Ejiao and Ai Ye, which is why it is named \"Jiao Ai Decoction,\" with Ejiao specifically used for stopping bleeding. \n\nNow you know that when there is gastric bleeding, we use Bai Ye (cypress leaf), which is a plant-based gelatin to stop the bleeding.

When cooking, we can add six bowls of water, then add one and a half or two bowls of rice wine, and cook together until it reduces to two bowls before drinking. These herbs need to be cooked with wine; however, it is also fine if you do not add wine. While decocting the medicine, we can assist the patient with acupuncture, using points that can stop bleeding and leakage, such as Yinbai on the spleen meridian and Dadu on the liver meridian to treat liver and spleen deficiency. We also add Sanyinjiao and Xuehai. After needling Xuehai, the patient's abdominal pain will subside, and Sanyinjiao can help invigorate the qi and blood of the liver and spleen. The points Dadu and Yinbai themselves can stop bleeding, and in this situation, the combination of acupuncture will yield faster results. After needling, while the patient's family is still decocting the medicine, the patient's bleeding will have already stopped; the effect is very quick, unless you needle the wrong point.\n\nFor women who are pregnant and experience abdominal cramping, we use the Danggui Shaoyao San (Angelica and Peony Powder).\n\nDanggui Shaoyao San formula:\nDanggui and Chuanxiong each 3 taels, Peony 1 pound, Poria and Bai Zhu each 4 taels, and Ze Xie ½ pound.\n\nMix these six ingredients, grind into a powder, and take a small spoonful with wine three times a day.\n\nDanggui Shaoyao San is a prescription used for women after becoming pregnant when excessive water accumulation leads to insufficient blood.

          "english_text": "Why does amenorrhea manifest in this way? Zhang Zhongjing stated that this condition is referred to as \"leukorrhea.\" For women's miscellaneous diseases, we have a unified term called \"leukorrhea.\" The reason for this is \"previous incomplete childbirth.\" Women may have experienced a miscarriage in their youth, leading to \"stagnation of blood in the lower abdomen.\" Some women, after giving birth, may not have had their uterus completely cleared, resulting in residual blood inside, which causes the current symptoms of dryness in the lips and mouth. At this time, \"Wen Jing Tang\" (Warm the Meridian Decoction) should be used for treatment. This is because when women experience amenorrhea, the uterus tends to atrophy, and using large doses of aggressive herbs is not appropriate. When the uterus is atrophied, we often use Wen Jing Tang, as there is stagnation of blood in the lower abdomen. Wen Jing Tang is specifically used for conditions of cold deficiency in the uterus. Therefore, it can be used not only during menopause but also for irregular menstruation or when there is stagnant blood in the uterus that cannot be expelled. It is also applicable for women experiencing infertility.\n\nWen Jing Tang has historically been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine as a prescription for seeking conception. Thus, one can note beside Wen Jing Tang \"long-term blood cold,\" indicating that over the years, cold blood has accumulated at the entrance of the uterus and within the uterus itself. \"Cold\" refers to a state of being cold, indicating a lack of oxygen, a state of stagnation, and the presence of blood clots accumulating in the uterus. Therefore, Wen Jing Tang is also a prescription for seeking conception. \n\nAs for Wu Zhu Yu (Evodia rutaecarpa), Zhang Zhongjing selected it because it enters the liver channel, which can invigorate liver blood and facilitate its flow to the uterus. Dang Gui (Angelica sinensis), Chuan Xiong (Ligusticum chuanxiong), and Shao Yao (Paeonia lactiflora) are all blood tonics that can increase blood volume. Ren Shen (Ginseng), Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig), along with the later additions of Sheng Jiang (Fresh Ginger) and Gan Cao (Licorice), are all herbs that promote Yang energy, which can invigorate Yang Qi. When Yang Qi is abundant, blood will also circulate, making these herbs effective for both generating Yang and invigorating blood.",

          "english_text": "Individuals with fluid deficiency often drink a lot of water but still cannot quench their thirst, continuously consuming more. This indicates that their gastrointestinal fluids are inherently insufficient. As previously mentioned, this is due to a deficiency of stomach fluids. Therefore, if a formula like Xiao Chai Hu Tang is prescribed to resolve the issue, administering a larger dose of Xiao Chai Hu Tang may cause the patient to sweat. In such cases, it is advisable to first needle the \"Dazhui\" point to release the excess heat from the Taiyang channel. Bloodletting at the \"Dazhui\" point is effective because the three Yang channels converge there, and once blood is released from the \"Dazhui\" point, the Taiyang heat will dissipate.\n\nWhy needle \"Fei Shu\" (Lung Shu)? This is because of stiffness and pain in the head and neck, which occurs when Lung Qi cannot disperse, preventing the exterior heat from dissipating. At this time, the heat from the chest Yang rises, causing headaches. Needling \"Fei Shu\" helps to release the exterior.\n\nWhy needle \"Gan Shu\" (Liver Shu)? This is due to liver swelling. It is essential to replenish the stomach's fluids when they are insufficient because if the fluids are lacking, the blood will become too hot, and there will not be enough water in the blood. At this point, the liver will swell because the liver is the final organ that stores blood. The heart generates blood, and the liver stores it; in fact, the liver is swollen, which is not a typical Xiao Chai Hu Tang syndrome. The liver swelling can press against the stomach, causing hardness in the stomach area. Therefore, needling \"Gan Shu\" helps to release the heat from the blood, allowing the blood within the liver to flow out. Thus, this is not a true Shaoyang syndrome.\n\nWhen a patient has fluid damage, it can be observed. Therefore, when administering a sweating agent to the patient, it is crucial to first examine the patient's lips. If the lips are dry, sweating should not be induced, as it may lead to delirium. Why does sweating cause delirium? Generally, when a patient has a strong fever, the brain's nerves may not function normally, leading to incoherent speech. \"Pulse is wiry, and for five to six days, delirium does not cease; one should needle 'Qimen'\" indicates that the liver is swollen.

The prescription included three qian of Fuzi (Aconite), one piece of raw Fuzi, and three qian of dried ginger, administered over three doses. This patient could not quench their thirst even when drinking water, due to a condition of vacuity heat. After taking such hot medicine, their thirst was alleviated.

Normally, the blood produced from the stomach's absorption of nutrients provides resistance, which is contained within the blood. Once the exterior pathogen invades, the resistance moves to the surface to combat it. At this time, menstruation occurs, causing the blood to descend, and the heat follows downwards as well. This pathogenic heat then enters the uterus and liver. The term \"blood chamber\" has been debated; some say it refers to the uterus, while others say it refers to the liver. In fact, both are considered blood chambers, and Zhang Zhongjing did not differentiate between them. \"Fullness in the chest and hypochondrium\" is due to the lymphatic system being associated with the Sanjiao (Triple Burner), where the uterus is considered part of the lower burner and the chest and hypochondrium are part of the middle burner. \"Resembling chest obstruction\" indicates that it appears like a chest obstruction. \"If there is delirium,\" it signifies that the patient's blood...",

If filtering viruses enter the bloodstream, and if blood stagnates there, it will carry many viruses, leading to vascular blockage. The liver contains many blood vessels; when blood is being circulated, the patient experiences fever, while when circulation is obstructed, the patient feels cold, resulting in alternating symptoms of chills and fever. \"Thus, it resembles malaria, with intermittent episodes.\"",

The first is when there is pain in the lower abdomen and frequent urination; the second is when the abdomen is not distended, but the person feels fullness. For urgent cases, use decoction; for less urgent cases, use pills.\" If urination is not smooth, it indicates blood stasis in the bladder, which corresponds to the formula Taohe Chengqi Decoction. Frequent urination corresponds to the formula Zhidang Decoction. Additionally, if the abdomen feels soft to the touch and the patient feels discomfort in the abdomen, this is also a blood condition. For urgent cases, use decoctions; for less urgent cases, use pills. Generally speaking, if the condition is superficial, the pain will be very acute; if the condition is deeper, the pain will be less urgent. Therefore, pills are used. Why use pills? Pills are characterized by their \"gentle and focused medicinal power.\" For \"acute conditions,\" which need to be expelled quickly, decoctions are used, as decoctions are cleansing. For gastrointestinal issues, powdered medicines are preferable.\n\nThe \"Fang Yu Nao\" states: \"In cases of upper syndrome, those with body deficiency are often afflicted. A person with body deficiency may have blood stasis in the lower abdomen, but it should not be attacked. However, if not attacked, the illness will not resolve. Well said! Chen Ziming modified this formula by removing 'Da Huang' and adding 'Di Huang,' naming it 'Tongjing Wan.' This slight modification effectively balances the need to attack and defend, and even the military strategies of Sun Wu are not excessive. I have used these four ingredients, decocted in water, to treat 'dry blood labor' with great efficacy.\" \"Dry blood labor\" refers to blood that has dried up in the abdominal cavity, and the patient's external symptoms include \"skin and muscle disorders,\" which are often seen in girls, particularly in the legs and abdomen, especially during winter.",

When rashes occur, they typically start from the abdominal area. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), if we see that the rash is red, the prognosis is grim—one in ten may survive. If the rash is black, the prognosis is even worse—one in ten may live, indicating that black is the most dangerous. Western medicine recognizes the strong infectious nature of this disease and that there are no Western medications to treat it. Therefore, when faced with such a situation, all items that the patient has touched are quickly gathered and burned.\n\nIf this infectious disease occurs during wartime, and soldiers become infected after prolonged combat, the contagion spreads rapidly. The onset of the disease starts from the abdominal area and quickly spreads to the limbs, and within one or two weeks, the person may die; this is referred to as \"war typhus.\" If it occurs in prisons, it is called \"prison typhus.\" On ships, it is termed \"ship typhus.\" Consider the commonalities among these locations. Firstly, the patients all have weak defenses, as their diets are not normal. Secondly, they are confined to a limited space, lacking freedom of movement, which is why most of them contract this disease.\n\nIn TCM, there are two categories referred to as \"yang toxin\" and \"yin toxin.\" Yang toxin primarily presents with symptoms of a \"red face with mottled patterns resembling brocade.\"",

Yang toxin primarily presents with symptoms such as \"facial redness with mottled patterns like brocade, and sore throat.\" Both Yang and Yin toxins can cause sore throat and the expulsion of pus and blood. When the body is excessively hot, it is classified as Yang toxin, which corresponds to the syndrome of Shengma Bieja Decoction. If you observe \"a bluish complexion\" and \"body pain as if beaten with a stick,\" it resembles the sensation of being whipped. Why does this feeling occur? It is because the flow of blood has slowed down, to the point where it seems to be on the verge of stopping. Due to the patient's poor blood circulation, the entire body feels as if it has been struck by a whip, resulting in pain. The symptoms of body pain can also be seen in Ma Huang Decoction, which is due to the exterior being constrained by cold, causing the Taiyang (Greater Yang) cold to be unable to circulate normally throughout the body, thus producing a similar sensation of pain. However, Taiyang syndrome is characterized by obstruction of the exterior water, while here, Yin toxin refers to obstruction of blood circulation; the two are entirely different. Clinically, when using the prescriptions here, they include herpes, commonly known as shingles. The area affected by shingles feels as if it has been struck by a whip, causing significant pain, and at this time, we can utilize these formulas. The formulas contain Bieja (tortoise shell), Xionghuang (realgar), and Shengma (Cimicifuga). Shengma has been discussed in the materia medica; I previously mentioned Ma Huang Shengma Decoction. In addition to its role in promoting the flow of body fluids, Shengma also has detoxifying properties and can counteract various toxins. At this time, Bieja is chosen because it is non-toxic in itself, but its nature is very strong and resilient. Furthermore, Bieja enters the liver meridian. When Bieja encounters Danggui (Angelica sinensis), since Bieja can penetrate deeply into the blood, when mixed with Danggui, it can reach the liver, and upon entering the liver, the liver will transform...",

          "english_text": "Due to excessive sweating all over the body, one might jump into the water to cool off. This does not mean that swimming in the Yellow River causes the body to turn yellow; in fact, jumping into the Yangtze River can also result in yellow sweat. The sweat produced from exercise originates from the Sanjiao (Triple Burner). When the body is sweating and one jumps into the water, the cold water from outside seals the skin's pores. Once the surface is sealed, the internal heat causes the moisture to want to escape but it cannot, leading to a situation where the skin may not appear yellow, yet the sweat that emerges is yellow. This is what is referred to as yellow sweat. If you observe a patient with yellow skin, that indicates jaundice. Yellow sweat, on the other hand, is when the patient's skin does not appear yellow, but the sweat that comes out is yellow. Historically, the individuals most affected by yellow sweat were ferry boatmen, and a distinctive symptom was the appearance of yellow discoloration in the armpit area of their clothing, which is indicative of yellow sweat.\n\nThe pulse is floating and surging; a floating pulse indicates wind, while a surging pulse indicates qi. When wind and qi clash, if the wind is strong, it leads to itching and the body becomes itchy. Itching is associated with the expulsion of wind, and if it persists, it can lead to scabs and leprosy. Strong qi can lead to water retention, making it difficult to bend or stretch. When wind and qi are interconnected, the body becomes swollen, and sweating can lead to recovery. If one is averse to wind, this indicates a deficiency, which is classified as wind-water; if one is not averse to wind, it suggests smooth urination, with cold in the upper jiao (upper burner) and excessive salivation, which is indicative of yellow sweat.\n\nThe phrase \"the pulse is floating and surging; floating indicates wind, surging indicates qi\" refers to lightly palpating the pulse on the patient's wrist, where a floating and surging pulse indicates strong internal qi. The qi in our body emerges from within, while wind enters from the outside. When we feel the cold wind from outside, our internal yang naturally rises to counteract the external pathogenic factors, resulting in the emergence of qi from within the body. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the term qi is often used. The concept of \"wind and qi clashing\" refers to the interaction between our internal yang qi and the external wind.",

          "english_text": "Evil forces clash, and what emerges from the body is Qi; in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the term \"Qi\" is often used. The phrase \"wind Qi contending\" refers to the conflict between the Yang Qi within our body and the external wind pathogens (filtered viruses). When the wind is stronger than the Yang Qi, it can lead to itching rashes, which are characterized by small, itchy red bumps on the skin. \"The body is itchy; itching leads to leakage.\" When there is itching, one naturally tends to scratch, and when the skin is scratched, Qi leaks out, resulting in reduced itching. \n\nIf the itching persists due to wind, a patient can be given Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang (Ephedra and Atractylodes Decoction). This formula is Ma Huang Tang (Ephedra Decoction) with the addition of Bai Zhu (Atractylodes), and its purpose is to induce a slight amount of surface sweating from the skin; it does not require excessive sweating to achieve healing. The cause of the itching rash is that our body is supposed to sweat normally, but it is obstructed by the external wind, causing the sweat pores to be constricted and preventing sweat from being expelled. At this point, sweat has already left the sweat glands but has not exited the pores, so it remains trapped beneath the skin, leading to itching. This is not a true skin disease; therefore, by using Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang to expel this stagnant sweat, the itching rash can be resolved. \n\nMa Huang Jia Zhu Tang is well-designed for this purpose, as it can effectively expel this layer of sweat without harming the normal body fluids. If the condition is due to liver disease causing ascites, one might say: \"Teacher, Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang can expel water.\" However, when this medicine is taken, the patient may not feel anything, as it is a different type of fluid accumulation. It is essential to confirm that the fluid is trapped beneath the skin before using Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang. If one is unaware that Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang specifically treats this type of itching rash and does not administer it to the patient, prolonged untreated wind rash can eventually develop into stubborn skin diseases such as scabs, leprosy, or scabies, among others.",

If wind rash is left untreated on the body for too long, it will eventually develop into stubborn skin diseases such as scabs, leprosy, or scabies, which are actually the initial causes of such conditions. Otherwise, why would the rash appear on you and not on others? I once saw a patient with psoriasis who had a very large body type; when the skin was pulled, there was a sizable patch that was red and looked like fish scales, arranged in neat layers. When scraped, a lot of dry skin would come off, and soon after, it would grow back. I intentionally described it in a disgusting way; as a doctor, one should not be afraid of such things. After examining one side, the patient would show me the other side, saying, \"Ah! I have it on my back too!\" When he pulled up his pants, his legs were covered, and there was a large patch on his thigh—his whole body was affected. Currently, Western medicine does not have effective treatments for such psoriasis. \n\nWhen encountering such skin diseases, it is important to note that the cause of these rashes is due to damp-heat within the body. If this damp-heat is not eliminated over a long period, and if sweat does not properly dissipate, it causes sweat to accumulate slowly beneath the skin. Meanwhile, the heat in the spleen and stomach cannot be expelled, leading to a buildup of damp-heat inside. At this point, if acupuncture is used for treatment, we can select anti-inflammatory points that are effective for skin diseases, such as Quchi (LI11), Hegu (LI4), Sanyinjiao (SP6), Xuehai (SP10), and Zhubin (SP2), which are specifically for treating skin itching. Additionally, we can prick and bleed at the locations where the rash appears on the skin, and then apply a topical powder made from Sanhuang Xiexin Decoction mixed with a bit of Bai Zhu powder as an external remedy. Internally, one can take Wumei Wan. Wumei Wan is a bitter-warm medicine that can transform dampness; for dampness caused by liver disease, Wumei Wan is essential.",

If one seeks to enhance vitality, Gui Zhi Long Gu Mu Li Tang is not as effective; we need to rely on formulas like Tian Xiong San (Heavenly Hero Powder) and similar remedies.\n\nFor individuals who have lost blood, if they are induced to sweat, they may experience \"cold shivering and trembling.\" As I mentioned earlier, sweat and blood share the same origin in the human body, so those with conditions such as epistaxis, blood loss, or sores should not be induced to sweat. Additionally, if a patient has numerous sores on their body, you should not induce sweating in that case either.\n\nA patient may present with fullness in the chest, dry lips, a bluish tongue, and a dry mouth, desiring to rinse with water but not wanting to swallow, without any signs of cold or heat. The pulse is weak, large, and slow, and the abdomen is not distended. The patient may express a feeling of fullness, indicating the presence of stagnant blood.\n\nThe phrase \"patient with fullness in the chest and dry lips\" marks the beginning of our discussion on the diagnostic principles of stagnant blood. How can we determine if there is stagnant blood in a patient's body? There are many causes of stagnant blood; some individuals may have retained remnants in the uterus after childbirth, while others may have internal injuries or trauma from falls.",

          "english_text": "Is there blood stasis in the body? There are many reasons for blood stasis. For some individuals, it may be due to retained lochia after childbirth that has not been completely expelled. For others, it may result from internal injuries or trauma, and various accidents can also lead to blood stasis within the body. There are several symptoms that can help us in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnose whether a patient has blood stasis. \n\nThe first symptom is \"chest fullness,\" where the patient feels a sensation of fullness in the chest. The second symptom is \"dry and shriveled lips,\" where the lips are dry and appear smaller. Why is this the case? I will explain shortly, but first, let’s note a few important symptoms. The second symptom is \"blue tongue and dry mouth,\" indicating dryness in the mouth and a bluish color of the tongue. \n\nIn TCM, the concept is that \"the heart governs blood.\" Therefore, when there is blood stasis, the force of blood returning to the heart is insufficient, leading to the sensation of chest fullness. For instance, when we use Gui Zhi Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction), if we encounter a patient with chest fullness, we need to remove Bai Shao (White Peony Root) because patients with heart issues will experience chest fullness. \n\nAdditionally, the spleen governs transportation and transformation; it is associated with the earth element and is yellow in color. The spleen plays a crucial role in the transportation of nutrients within our body. During the process of blood production, if there is blood stasis obstructing the body, this stasis may be located in the stomach or intestines, regardless of its exact location. The presence of blood stasis indicates a problem with blood circulation, which prevents normal blood from being transported to the limbs. \n\nMoreover, the spleen opens to the lips, so at this time, we can observe that the patient's mouth appears drier and more withered, lacking moisture. The tongue may exhibit a bluish color, but this bluish hue is not uniform across the entire tongue; rather, it is observed on both sides of the tongue body. This is something I have seen clinically many times. Generally, when encountering individuals with internal injuries, extending the tongue reveals these characteristics.",

          "english_text": "The entire tongue appears bluish-green, particularly on both sides of the tongue body. This observation is derived from clinical experience, as I have seen many cases. Generally, when encountering individuals with internal injuries, if they extend their tongue and both sides are bluish, it indicates the presence of internal injury. Additionally, patients may experience significant dryness in the mouth due to blood stasis obstructing the back, where blood has already left the blood vessels and is retained in the muscle tissue or between the organs, leading to such symptoms. Patients may express a desire to rinse their mouths but do not want to swallow; this reflects a psychological urge to drink water, yet when the water reaches their mouths, they do not wish to ingest it. These symptoms are all indicative of external manifestations of blood stasis.\n\nIn our clinical practice, we have observed many women who, after undergoing surgery for breast cancer, experience extreme dryness in the mouth, finding it difficult to drink water, and when they do, they end up vomiting it back. This indicates the presence of blood stasis within the body, which hinders proper blood circulation. At this time, they may feel very thirsty, yet drinking water leads to vomiting.\n\nThe term \"no cold or heat\" refers to the observation that a patient's tongue may be dry, possibly indicating Yangming heat. When we take the pulse, there is no indication of cold or heat, nor are there any exterior or interior symptoms; \"no cold or heat\" means there are not even exterior symptoms present. The pulse of blood stasis is slightly larger and arrives late; this requires clinical experience to discern through palpation. \n\nWhen a patient states, \"My abdomen is not full, yet I feel full,\" it means that although the patient's abdomen does not appear distended, they continuously report a sensation of fullness and heaviness inside. However, externally, there is no visible distension, which also indicates the presence of blood stasis within. All of the above are symptoms of internal blood stasis.\n\nYou mentioned: \"Teacher, today I encountered a mute person whose hair is very long, and their face is obscured.\" Or if someone has sustained an injury and their face is bruised, making it difficult to see, how do you examine them?

          "english_text": "Then, his hair is very long, and his face is covered. Or he might have fallen and has bruises on his face that we cannot see; how can you examine him? Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has very specific methods for examining blood stasis. When there is stasis in the body, there are several areas that can be checked, and this applies to both men and women. The left side of the human body is associated with blood, while the right side is associated with qi. In the lower left abdomen, above the Chongmen point, there is a tender point, and there is also tenderness below the seventh vertebra in the back, because blood can accumulate at the Ge Shu point. When pressure is applied to these areas, even if the person is mute, there will be a strong reaction, such as the legs retracting or the brow furrowing.\n\nAdditionally, there is the Sanyinjiao point, which is where the three yin meridians intersect. The term \"yin\" refers to the deepest areas, while \"yang\" refers to the surface; yin is deeper. When there is blood stasis within the organs, the blood does not remain stagnant; it gradually seeps into deeper tissues, entering the yin areas. The yin regions are not necessarily the genital areas; for example, when there is blood stasis deep within the organs, such as below the liver or spleen, tenderness can also be found at the Sanyinjiao point, which can be observed clinically.\n\nThe most obvious and easily observable sign is the tongue. By extending the tongue, one can immediately discern the presence of blood stasis. For instance, if a woman's tongue has many tooth marks on the sides, it indicates gynecological issues. Some individuals may have a bluish tongue with patchy distributions, which also signifies blood stasis. When blood stasis is present, we must first address the stasis; resolving the stasis will alleviate the condition. Methods to address blood stasis include formulas like Taohua Chengqi Decoction and Ditang Decoction, which are designed to move blood stasis. When addressing blood stasis, it is crucial to be particularly careful with the prescription; we must assess the patient and determine the specific location of the stasis.",

Frequent urination corresponds to the Didao Decoction. Additionally, if the abdomen feels soft to the touch and the patient feels discomfort in the abdomen, this is also a blood condition. For urgent cases, use decoctions; for less urgent cases, use pills. Generally speaking, if the condition is superficial, the pain will be very urgent; if the condition is deeper, the pain will be less urgent, hence the use of pills. Why use pills? Pills are chosen for their \"gentle and focused medicinal power.\" For \"acute conditions,\" they need to be expelled quickly, so decoctions are used. Decoctions are for cleansing; for gastrointestinal issues, powdered medicines are preferable.\n\nThe \"Fang Yu Nao\" states: \"In cases of upper symptoms, those with body deficiency are often afflicted. A person with body deficiency may have blood stasis in the lower abdomen, but it should not be attacked. However, if not attacked, the illness will not resolve. Well said!

This slight modification fully utilizes the ability to attack while preserving the defense, which is unparalleled even in the military strategies of Sun Wu.

If there is no blood, the patient will exhibit jaundice, a deep and tight pulse, hardness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, indicating a lack of blood. In such cases, \"Yinchenhao Decoction\" will be used. Yinchenhao Decoction specifically targets heat in the bladder.

Bile is yellow; if there is excessive heat in the bladder, the secretion of bile becomes too heated, leading to jaundice in the patient. One should not underestimate blood stasis; it may not be visible on X-rays, yet it can lead to manic behavior. This stasis can sometimes travel to the brain. Depending on the situation, either \"Dachengqi Decoction\" or \"Dingdang Decoction\" may be used, so it is important to observe the urination patterns.

The difficulty in urination may be due to kidney stones, and the use of Wuling San (Five-Ingredient Powder) could help resolve this. Currently, the patient is experiencing considerable pain, but upon palpation, the abdomen feels soft, suggesting that there is stagnant blood inside. To differentiate whether there is blood stagnation, we assess the urination; if it is not smooth, we note that \"no excess medicine should be used, and it is advisable to use Diding Wan (Resisting the Pathogen Pill).\" Other medications are ineffective, and it is essential to use Diding Wan. The symptoms appear milder compared to those treated with Diding Tang (Resisting the Pathogen Decoction), but the underlying condition is more severe.\n\n**Diding Wan Formula:**\n- 20 pieces of leeches (boiled)\n- 25 pieces of fly larvae (boiled, wings removed)\n- 20 pieces of peach kernels (peeled and pointed ends removed)\n- 3 taels of rhubarb (soaked in wine)\n\nCombine these four ingredients, pound them into four pills, and use one pill with one liter of water, boiling it down to seven cups for consumption. If blood is expelled, it should be taken immediately; if not, take another dose. The peach kernels are very sticky, and the crushed leeches are also sticky, so they are divided into four pills. Generally, 20 leeches weigh about 2 qian, 25 fly larvae are approximately 2.5 qian, 20 peach kernels weigh 2 qian, and 3 qian of rhubarb is used. \"Jue Shi\" refers to the time after taking the medicine today, which is at least 24 hours; if blood is expelled, no further doses are needed. If blood is expelled, only one pill should be taken at a time. The amount of stagnant blood varies among individuals, so while the prescription remains the same, the dosage may differ. Stop taking the medicine once the desired effect is achieved.\n\nAccording to the \"Liu Ju Fang Guang Yi,\" this formula states: \"In my family, we use this formula, taking the four ingredients to make a powder and then refining it with honey into pills.\" Using raw honey will enhance the effect. It also states: \"If it forms into lumps, it is suitable for chronic patients; although they may have taken medicine regularly, it is still difficult to achieve results.\"",

          "english_text": "In comparison to heat, when the internal deficiency heat interacts with the external yang heat, the patient feels very uncomfortable. In winter, this condition tends to improve because the cold outside can restrain the heat. Additionally, individuals with severe labor syndrome may experience the phenomenon of \"yin cold essence emerging.\"\n\nZhang Zhongjing conveyed in a very simple manner that most individuals suffering from labor syndrome exhibit a pattern of heat above and cold below—meaning that above the navel is hot, while below is cold. The navel serves as the boundary between yin and yang. The area below is characterized by yin cold, which signifies a lack of dynamic energy and a cessation of peristalsis, leading to poor metabolism. Conversely, the upper body is excessively hot and overly exuberant. In a healthy individual, yin is above and yang is below, which prevents yang from floating upwards, allowing our dynamic energy to remain concealed, referred to as \"hidden yang.\" In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the emphasis is not on having an abundance of yang, but rather on its ability to be concealed.\n\nTherefore, if a patient has yang heat above that cannot descend, this heat will rise to the extremities. At this time, the lower jiao becomes a gathering place for yin cold, which can lead to \"essence emerging.\" The patient may exhibit several symptoms; for men, this may manifest as nocturnal emissions or dreams of sexual intercourse. Older individuals often experience the phenomenon of essence leaking due to yang deficiency, which leads to a loss of control, resulting in involuntary emissions. This symptom can be very distressing, but can be effectively treated with herbal medicine.\n\nFurthermore, the symptom of \"soreness and weakness preventing movement\" arises because the lower jiao is deficient and cold, causing essence to leak out. Women do not possess essence, but when this occurs in females, it results in excessive vaginal discharge that continuously drips, which can also lead to a depletion of energy. When this phenomenon occurs, it can affect sleep at night. This is because the kidneys govern the bones.",

          "english_text": "The white discharge can be quite abundant, continuously dripping out, which can lead to a deficiency in the body. When this phenomenon occurs, it can affect sleep at night. Since the kidneys govern the bones, excessive leakage of kidney essence can lead to a sensation of soreness in the bones. The term \"soreness that prevents movement\" here indicates that the patient feels soreness in the bones rather than in the muscles. Therefore, some individuals who have suffered from labor-related conditions for many years without treatment may eventually develop nocturnal emissions. This essence continues to leak out, which the patient cannot tolerate, leading to significant distress and daily fatigue. We have herbal remedies that can help stabilize their Yang deficiency, as well as those that can replenish their Yin deficiency, among others.\n\nIn men, a weak and floating pulse indicates infertility, with clear and cold essence. Here, it is stated that if the pulse is \"floating and weak,\" the floating pulse represents the Qi pulse. When the pulse rises, it indicates that the Qi is ascending, meaning the patient's exterior is deficient. A weak pulse signifies insufficient blood, indicating that the patient's essence and blood are inadequate, which suggests an internal deficiency. Patients exhibiting this phenomenon will certainly struggle with fertility, as their \"essence is clear and cold.\" Such men find it difficult to conceive, meaning that those with labor-related conditions are less likely to become pregnant. However, we have prescriptions in Chinese medicine that can treat this condition. You can refer to the formula below; after one or two doses, you will know whether it is effective.\n\nThus, if a child aged seventeen or eighteen has a pale complexion, it indicates that he is in the early stages of development, and this physiological response may cause nocturnal emissions during sleep. If it happens occasionally, one or two times, it is quite normal and not a major concern, as fullness leads to overflow. However, if it becomes severe, the individual may become deficient, and at this point, one can observe that their complexion is entirely pale, and they exhibit a lack of energy. This corresponds to the diagnosis of Gui Zhi Long Gu Mu Li Tang.",

This corresponds to the syndrome treated by Gui Zhi Long Gu Mu Li Tang (Cinnamon Twig, Dragon Bone, and Oyster Decoction).\n\nIn cases of seminal loss, there may be a tense and painful sensation in the lower abdomen, coldness in the genital area, dizziness, hair loss, and a pulse that is extremely weak, thin, and slow, indicating a deficiency of essence and blood. The pulse may feel slightly tight and moving, with men experiencing seminal loss and women having dreams of sexual intercourse. Gui Zhi Long Gu Mu Li Tang is indicated for these conditions.\n\nThe formula for Gui Zhi Long Gu Mu Li Tang includes:\n- 3 taels of Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig)\n- 3 taels of Shao Yao (Peony Root)\n- 3 taels of Sheng Jiang (Fresh Ginger)\n- 2 taels of Gan Cao (Licorice Root)\n- 12 pieces of Da Zao (Jujube)\n- 3 taels of Long Gu (Dragon Bone)\n- 3 taels of Mu Li (Oyster Shell)\n\nCombine these seven ingredients with 7 sheng (approximately 1.5 liters) of water, boil down to 3 sheng (approximately 0.6 liters), and divide into three warm doses.\n\nIn general, both insufficient essence and unstable essence fall under the category of seminal loss, which is referred to as a condition of deficiency and fatigue. The term \"tense and painful sensation in the lower abdomen\" refers to tension caused by damage to the kidney yang, creating a sensation as if a tendon is being pulled in the lower abdomen. This occurs because water cannot nourish wood; the liver governs the tendons, and without water to moisten the liver wood, the tendons become tense, as the liver's tendons are directly connected to the lower abdomen. \n\nTypically, if there is pain in the lower abdomen, it is often due to excessive cold in the spleen, and in such cases, practitioners would commonly use Bai Shao (White Peony) to alleviate abdominal pain. However, in this situation, using Bai Shao is ineffective because the patient is experiencing \"tense tendons,\" which is due to liver deficiency.\n\nThe term \"coldness in the genital area\" indicates that the area feels icy, and this is often accompanied by dizziness. \"Hair loss\" refers to the loss of hair. The pulse being \"extremely weak, thin, and slow\" signifies that the internal essence is severely depleted. The symptom of \"diarrhea with clear stools\" indicates that food ingested is not being properly absorbed due to excessive cold in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to undigested food being expelled. This is what is meant by diarrhea with clear stools. The patient originally has insufficient blood, and now with the addition of fluid loss...",

As soon as Ren Shen Bai Hu Tang is consumed, after a few doses, blood sugar levels will return to normal. The second type is lower burner diabetes, characterized by impotence; Shen Qi Wan may need to be taken for a longer duration, approximately six months continuously. The third type is middle burner diabetes, where one feels hungry even after eating a hundred bowls, caused by excessive heat in the spleen, which is what I am going to introduce now.\n\nWhen treating middle burner thirst, it is important to note the following when prescribing: First, we need to slow down the gastric motility, which means reducing the stomach fire. Second, we must simultaneously clear out the waste in the large intestine, as the large intestine is inherently hot. If a lot of waste accumulates inside, the heat cannot dissipate and becomes trapped, leading to increased heat; therefore, it must be cleared out at the same time. These pathogenic causes are closely related to the busy social behaviors of our current industrial and commercial society, as well as our lifestyle habits. \n\nSitting at work every day means that our blood sugar levels require more movement to be consumed. However, due to excessive time spent sitting in the office and a lack of exercise, combined with sometimes being too busy to eat a proper meal during the day, we end up having a late-night snack when we return home before going to sleep. Consequently, food remains trapped in the stomach for too long. Ideally, it is healthier for our stomach to be empty while we sleep, as gastric motility gradually slows down during sleep.

If a person eats a lot of food before going to bed, the stomach, which contains food, cannot remain inactive and thus experiences pressure and congestion. Normally, during sleep, the stomach fire decreases and peristalsis slows down. However, if food is consumed, it stimulates the stomach to continue peristalsis, leading to a situation where the stomach is active while the person is asleep. Over time, this can result in elevated blood sugar levels. \n\nWestern medicine states that diabetes can be hereditary, but this is a partial truth; it should be prefaced with the phrase \"lifestyle habits.\" It is not that the physical constitution is inherited. Today, if a person's pancreas becomes fatty, it does not mean that their child will also have a fatty pancreas—such a thing does not happen. In reality, it is due to shared lifestyle habits. For instance, a father who is busy working in a factory or company may not see his wife and children all day. When he returns home late, he calls out, \"Everyone get up and eat with Dad; I want to chat with you.\" Thus, the family ends up having late-night snacks together, discussing school matters, and then going to bed, day after day. \n\nIf the father's lifestyle habits are unhealthy, he may develop diabetes, and consequently, his son may adopt the same late-night snacking habits, leading to the son also developing diabetes in the future.

Children who grow up eating late-night snacks with their fathers also develop this habit; if they don’t eat, their hands and feet tremble, and they must eat before they can sleep. This is the reason behind it.\n\nThere are also external symptoms; in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), it is believed that if the exterior symptoms are not treated, the disease can progress to the Yangming stage, leading to persistent thirst and dryness, which is another pathogenic cause.

If there were a medication that not only prevents weight gain but also promotes weight loss, the mere fact that patients lose weight would indicate a decrease in blood sugar levels. \n\nFor the condition of thirst due to middle-jiao dysfunction, a prescription must be designed to reduce stomach fire while also promoting bowel movement. Originally, patients would eat a hundred bowls of food and still feel hungry; after taking Chinese medicine, they would feel full after eating just a little, indicating that their stomach has shrunk. At this point, the temperature of the spleen and stomach would immediately drop, and the heat in the large intestine would be expelled along with the stool. \n\nIn ancient times, there were no airplanes or cars, and visiting neighbors required walking several kilometers, so most people had a lot of physical activity. Therefore, this condition was more common among wealthy families. Nowadays, with many cars and a lifestyle of comfort, people sit without moving, leading to an increase in diabetes cases. \n\nIf diabetes is not treated, it will eventually progress to complications.",

Boil with five bowls of water until three bowls remain, drink the first bowl, and do not drink again if there is a \"down\" reaction, which means passing blood. Do not be nervous; the fetus in the abdomen will not be harmed.\n\nThe definition of the Dongdongweng formula states: \"To treat those with blood stasis, there are two types. One is when there is pain in the lower abdomen and frequent urination; the other is when the abdomen is not full, but the person feels fullness. For urgent cases, use decoction; for less urgent cases, use pills.\" Difficulty in urination indicates blood stasis in the bladder, which corresponds to the Peach Kernel Chengqi Decoction. Frequent urination corresponds to the Didao Decoction. Additionally, if the abdomen feels soft and the patient experiences discomfort, this is also a blood condition. For urgent cases, use decoctions; for less urgent cases, use pills. Generally speaking, if the condition is superficial, the pain will be very urgent; if the condition is deeper, the pain will be less urgent. Therefore, pills are used. Why use pills? Pills are characterized by their \"gentle and focused medicinal power.\" For \"acute\" conditions that need to be expelled quickly, decoctions are used, as decoctions are cleansing. For gastrointestinal issues, powdered medicines are preferable.\n\nThe \"Fangyu Nao\" states: \"In cases of upper syndrome, those with body deficiency are often afflicted. A person with body deficiency may have blood stasis in the lower abdomen, but it should not be attacked. However, if not attacked, the illness will not resolve. Well said! Chen Ziming removed 'rhubarb' from this formula and added 'rehmannia,' naming it 'Tongjing Wan.' With just this one modification, it effectively addresses both the attacking and tonifying aspects. The military strategies of Sun Wu are not sufficient to surpass this. I have used these four ingredients, decocted in water, to treat 'dry blood labor' with great efficacy.\" \"Dry blood labor\" refers to blood that has dried up in the abdominal cavity. The patient's external symptoms include \"skin peeling,\" which is commonly seen in girls, particularly on the legs and abdomen, and occurs every winter when the skin sheds.",

This manifests as shedding skin on the legs and abdomen during winter, where the skin becomes dry and resembles snake skin, while in summer, it appears normal. This condition is essentially \"dry blood deficiency.\"\n\n139. \"Taiyang disease\" presents with jaundice, a deep and tight pulse, hardness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, indicating a lack of blood. If urination is smooth, the person may appear manic, which is a sign of blood stasis; \"Dingdang Decoction\" is indicated for this condition.\n\nThis can be further divided into two categories: one with smooth urination and one with difficulty in urination, to differentiate between blood presence and absence. If there is no blood, the symptoms include jaundice, a deep and tight pulse, hardness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, indicating a lack of blood. In such cases, \"Yinchenhao Decoction\" will be used. Yinchenhao Decoction specifically targets heat in the bladder. When there is heat burning below, after the bladder has been vaporized, some unhealthy urine is expelled while some good fluid enters the gallbladder, aiding in digestion. Bile is yellow; if there is excessive heat in the bladder, the secretion of bile becomes too hot, leading to jaundice in the patient. One should not underestimate blood stasis; it may not be visible on X-rays, yet it can lead to manic behavior. This stasis can sometimes affect the brain. Depending on the situation, one might use \"Dachengqi Decoction\" or \"Dingdang Decoction.\" Therefore, it is essential to observe whether urination is smooth or difficult. If urination is smooth, \"Dingdang Decoction\" should be used. If the urine is very yellow, it indicates excessive heat in the lower jiao, and if there is no bowel movement, \"Dachengqi Decoction\" should be employed to purge.\n\n140. In \"Shanghan\" (cold damage), if there is heat, fullness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, but the patient experiences smooth urination, this indicates the presence of blood stasis. It is necessary to purge immediately without leaving any medication behind, and \"Dingdang Pill\" is recommended.\n\nHeat accumulation in the bladder should typically result in difficulty urinating; however, if urination is normal, and the patient reports pain in the lower abdomen around the \"Zhongji\" and \"Guanyuan\" areas, this pain arises from obstruction. If urination is good, it indicates that blood is blocked.",

The patient reports significant pain in the lower abdomen, particularly around the \"Zhongji\" and \"Guanyuan\" areas. The pain is associated with obstruction; however, urination is good, indicating that blood is blocked. The difficulty in urination may be due to kidney stones, and the use of Wuling San (Five-Ingredient Powder) could help resolve this. Currently, the patient is experiencing considerable pain, but upon palpation, the abdomen feels soft, suggesting that there is stagnant blood inside. To diagnose whether there is blood stagnation, we assess the ease of urination. \n\nIt is advised not to use any other medications and to specifically use Diding Wan (Resisting the Counteracting Pill). Other medications are ineffective; Diding Wan must be used. The symptoms appear milder than those treated with Diding Tang (Resisting the Counteracting Decoction), but the underlying condition is more severe. \n\nDiding Wan formula:\n- 20 pieces of leeches (boiled)\n- 25 pieces of fly larvae (boiled, wings removed)\n- 20 pieces of peach kernels (peeled and pointed ends removed)\n- 3 taels of rhubarb (soaked in wine)\n\nCombine these four ingredients, pound them into four pills, and use one pill with one liter of water, boiling it down to seven cups for consumption. The patient should take this after a meal, and if blood does not pass, they should take another dose. \n\nPeach kernels are very sticky, and crushed leeches are also sticky, so they are divided into four pills. Generally, 20 leeches weigh about 2 qian, 25 fly larvae are approximately 2.5 qian, 20 peach kernels weigh 2 qian, and rhubarb is 3 qian. The term \"after a meal\" refers to taking it today, and the patient should expect to see blood within at least 24 hours. If blood is passed, they do not need to take more; if not, they should take another pill. Each person's amount of stagnant blood varies, so while the prescription remains the same, the dosage may differ. They should stop once they have taken enough.\n\nAccording to the \"Liu Ju Fang Guang Yi,\" this formula states: \"In my family, we use this formula, taking the four left ingredients and grinding them into a powder, then refining with honey into pills.\" Using raw honey will enhance the effect. It also states: \"If it forms into lumps, it is for chronic patients. Although they may have taken medicine regularly, it is still difficult to achieve results.\"",

          "english_text": "By the fourth or fifth day, although the patient can eat, administer a small amount of Xiao Chengqi Decoction gently to promote mild relief, allowing for a small bowel movement first. By the fifth or sixth day, give one sheng (approximately 240 ml) of Xiao Chengqi Decoction again, but if there is still no bowel movement, and if the urination is scant, even if the patient cannot eat, the stool will initially be hard but will eventually become loose. If it has not yet solidified into hard stool, aggressive treatment will lead to loose stools. It is necessary to ensure a small bowel movement; if the stool is confirmed to be hard, then it can be treated aggressively with Da Chengqi Decoction. \n\nThe initial hard stool followed by loose stools indicates excessive dampness. The immune system, resistance, and nutrition all originate from the Middle Jiao. During a febrile disease, the exterior heat penetrates inward, leading to a deficiency in the stomach. Heat signifies inflammation; once heat arises, inflammation intensifies. Inflammation tends to ascend, which can later lead to conditions such as meningitis. The human body is a closed cavity; as heat rises, the stomach shrinks, and the spleen becomes reversed, leading to dampness from the spleen that obstructs the flow. This is why there is initially hard stool followed by loose stool; at first, the stool is hard, but later it becomes loose. \n\nIn such cases, as long as the stool is loose, there must be dampness present. Do not treat aggressively; simply administer Xiao Chengqi Decoction. It is essential to confirm that there is a small bowel movement, indicating that the dampness has found a way to drain, which means that the heat within the large intestine has been fully transformed. Therefore, in cases of Da Chengqi Decoction syndrome, urination remains smooth. The confirmation of a small bowel movement indicates that the dampness in the spleen has been completely resolved, and the dampness has transformed into dryness, meaning that the stool inside has already dried out. Confirm this before using Da Chengqi Decoction for aggressive treatment. \n\nThis differentiation emphasizes that Da Chengqi Decoction should only be used when the dampness in the Middle Jiao has completely transformed into heat. In fact, the symptoms of scant urination, abdominal fullness, and loose stools indicate that there is dampness inside, and a combination of Wuling San and Da Chengqi Decoction can be used.",

          "english_text": "In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), one must wait until the internal deficiency has recovered before administering exterior-releasing medications. Therefore, when encountering a patient with internal deficiency, it is essential to first treat the internal deficiency before addressing the exterior symptoms.\n\n116. For \"Taiyang disease,\" if it has persisted for more than ten days and has recurred two or three times, and after another four or five days the \"Chaihu syndrome\" is still present, one should first administer \"Xiao Chai Hu Tang.\" If the patient experiences persistent vomiting, a sense of urgency in the chest, and mild irritability, this indicates that the condition has not yet resolved; in this case, administering \"Da Chai Hu Tang\" will lead to recovery.\n\nThe phrase \"more than ten days\" indicates that the illness has been prolonged for over ten days, and logically, it should have progressed to another stage. However, if the exterior symptoms persist and the physician does not prescribe exterior-releasing medications but instead resorts to purging, the original Taiyang syndrome, which should have resolved the exterior symptoms and allowed the illness to manifest outwardly, instead progresses inward. If after another four or five days the Chaihu syndrome is still present, one should first give Xiao Chai Hu Tang. If the patient continues to experience \"persistent vomiting, a sense of urgency in the chest, and mild irritability,\" this indicates that the stomach is still distended and uncomfortable due to unresolved issues; thus, administering Da Chai Hu Tang will lead to recovery.\n\nDa Chai Hu Tang itself is situated between the Shaoyang and Yangming stages, and it is used when both Shaoyang and Yangming symptoms are present. The symptoms of \"persistent vomiting, a sense of urgency in the chest, and mild irritability\" suggest that the intestines and stomach are obstructed by feces, with retained food causing blockage. Therefore, the primary symptoms of Da Chai Hu Tang include abdominal fullness, distension, and vomiting; vomiting is associated with Shaoyang, while abdominal fullness is linked to Yangming. Abdominal fullness and nausea are the main symptoms of Da Chai Hu Tang. In modern contexts, the symptom of Qi fullness corresponds to the formula of Hou Po, Sheng Jiang, Ban Xia, and Gan Cao; actual fullness corresponds to Cheng Qi Tang; and abdominal fullness with nausea corresponds to Da Chai Hu Tang. If there is only vomiting without abdominal fullness, it indicates Xiao Chai Hu Tang syndrome. Why is this? Because the purging medications were too aggressive, leading to excessive loss of fluids; the stool that is expelled is primarily watery.",

          "english_text": "The presence of abdominal fullness and light vomiting indicates a Xiao Chai Hu Tang syndrome. Why is that? Because the condition has been purged too aggressively, leading to excessive loss of fluids; the patient's stools are watery, resulting in a situation where the feces are not fully expelled and thus become obstructed inside. Clinically, we observe that patients with colon cancer initially present with either Cheng Qi Tang syndrome or Da Chai Hu Tang syndrome. They are not in the Yangming stage, but rather in a state between Shaoyang and Yangming. In the Yangming stage, there are no signs of death, which indicates that this condition is not dangerous. However, patients who have undergone surgical treatment in Western medicine may develop liver or lung cancer post-surgery, presenting symptoms that align with either Shaoyin or Jueyin syndromes. Therefore, we naturally oppose surgical interventions by Western medicine.\n\nFor patients with colon cancer who have not yet undergone surgery, if the obstruction is located at the distal end of the colon, near the rectum, we should add Mangxiao to break the obstruction. When we encounter constipation with excess patterns, where the patient resists abdominal palpation and cannot pass gas, we consider the use of Mangxiao.\n\nThe formula for Da Chai Hu Tang is as follows:\n- Chai Hu: 250 grams\n- Huang Qin: 180 grams\n- Shao Yao: 180 grams\n- Ban Xia: 75 grams (washed)\n- Sheng Jiang: 250 grams (sliced)\n- Zhi Shi: 4 pieces (roasted)\n- Da Zao: 12 pieces (split)\n- Da Huang: 120 grams (Ban Xia is approximately 75 grams)\n\nCombine these eight ingredients with 12 liters of water, boil down to 6 liters, strain, and then re-boil to obtain 3 liters. Administer 1 liter warm, three times a day.\n\nFor Da Huang, heavier individuals should use 6 grams, while lighter individuals can use 3 grams. The combination of Chai Hu, Huang Qin, Ban Xia, Sheng Jiang, and Da Zao constitutes Xiao Chai Hu Tang. By omitting Ren Shen and Gan Cao, and adding Shao Yao, Zhi Shi, and Da Huang, we create Da Chai Hu Tang. Zhi Shi is also a herb that can help to relieve intestinal obstruction, similar to Hou Po; however, Zhi Shi is more effective for the large intestine, while Hou Po is more effective for moistening the small intestine. The large intestine and lungs are interrelated, so when there is obstruction in the large intestine, Zhi Shi should be used.",

The large intestine and lungs are interconnected, so when there is blockage in the large intestine, Zhi Shi is used. It is also used when there is congestion in the chest cavity or fluid accumulation in the heart. Zhi Shi is specifically capable of eliminating toxic masses and hard lumps, effectively expelling them from the body. \n\nIn practice, it has been observed that when the intestinal wall of the large intestine adheres to the stool, Zhi Shi can help separate them. However, it can only facilitate their separation; if Zhi Shi were to clear it out completely, there would be no need to add Da Huang (Rhubarb) or Mang Xiao (Glauber's Salt). Therefore, Zhi Shi itself does not have a purgative function; it can only separate the masses, and other herbs are needed to help expel them.\n\nWhen there is blockage in the arterial blood vessels of the heart, Zhi Shi is used, but it merely separates the obstructive material from the vessel walls. Zhang Zhongjing also added Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig) to enhance the force that pushes the blood through the heart's arteries, increasing the ejection power. To prevent the stomach from being overwhelmed, Sheng Jiang (Fresh Ginger) is added to disperse some of the heat, preventing it from concentrating too much in the heart, which could lead to rupture of the blood vessels.\n\nDue to abdominal fullness and distension, there may be pain in the lower abdomen, so Shao Yao (Peony) is added. If Da Huang is not included in the formula for Da Chai Hu Tang (Major Bupleurum Decoction), it cannot be called Da Chai Hu Tang, because the condition has already progressed to the Shao Yang and Yang Ming stages, and it is not purely a Yang Ming syndrome. Therefore, there is no need for a strong herb like Mang Xiao; Da Huang is sufficient to clear the Yang Ming heat.\n\nDa Chai Hu Tang is essentially Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Minor Bupleurum Decoction) with Ren Shen (Ginseng) and Gan Cao (Licorice) removed, and Zhi Shi, Da Huang, and Shao Yao added. Since Yang Ming syndrome involves real heat, it is not appropriate to use Ren Shen and Gan Cao, which are tonifying herbs, because the Yang Ming condition has already affected the intestines. We should avoid using Gan Cao, which would cause the herbs to stagnate in the stomach, as Yang Ming real heat is present.",

Therefore, strengthening the middle jiao is ineffective in this case, and at this time, Chi Shi Zhi (Red Stone) and Yu Yu Liang (Grain of Yu) decoction should be used. \n\n\"When diarrhea does not stop, one should promote urination.\" This principle is found in the \"Shang Han Lun\" (Treatise on Cold Damage) and \"Jin Kui Yao Lue\" (Essential Prescriptions of the Golden Coffer). When treating diarrhea, if the prescription does not stop the diarrhea, one must promote urination, finding ways to direct the water from the large and small intestines to the bladder for urination, thus stopping the diarrhea. In clinical practice, including cases of cholera and dysentery with vomiting and diarrhea, promoting urination can help stop the diarrhea. The best herbs for promoting urination are Zhu Ling (Polyporus) and Ze Xie (Alisma), so these should be added to the anti-diarrheal formula.\n\nGenerally, when diarrhea is severe, one should first use Chi Shi Zhi and Yu Yu Liang, as these two herbs are astringents and stone-based medicines. Currently, Yu Yu Liang is rare, and most of what is available on the market is Chi Shi Zhi. In clinical cases of persistent diarrhea, it is not necessary to use the Chi Shi Zhi and Yu Yu Liang decoction, as Yu Yu Liang is not easily obtainable. Instead, one can use Bai Zhu (Atractylodes) and Chi Shi Zhi. Bai Zhu is typically processed in the pharmacy by frying it with yellow earth, and there is also a method of frying Bai Zhu together with Chi Shi Zhi. When Bai Zhu is used to strengthen the stomach and spleen, it is usually fried with yellow earth; however, when used to stop diarrhea, it is fried with Chi Shi Zhi. This can be added to Xiao Jian Zhong Tang (Minor Construct the Middle Decoction) or Ban Xia Xie Xin Tang (Pinellia Decoction to Drain the Heart), and the diarrhea will stop.\n\nHow to differentiate symptoms of diarrhea with blood?

The stomach qi, which should normally descend, is disrupted; food enters the stomach, gets ground up, and then moves into the small intestine and subsequently the large intestine, following a downward path. The stomach's peristaltic movement is directed downward. However, due to excessive vomiting, the stomach qi rises instead. When there is nothing in the stomach, the qi surges upward to the throat, causing the patient to feel a continuous upward pressure reaching the throat. The patient experiences dizziness and lightheadedness due to insufficient blood, leading to a state of hypoxia. If sweating is induced under these conditions, the water content in the blood decreases further, causing more harm. When the water content in the blood is insufficient, the patient may exhibit high fever, resulting in a weak pulse. The patient experiences \"meridian movement and vigilance,\" as the blood is insufficient to nourish the tendons, leading to \"long-term atrophy.\" This is how conditions like poliomyelitis arise; many initial cases stem from improperly managed fevers and colds.

If the patient does not have exterior heat but only has floating heat within the body, feeling stuffy, with a pulse that is not very floating, and feeling a bit dazed with a slight fever that is not very high, what should be done? The only solution is to induce a slight sweat to dissipate the heat. At this time, Guadi Powder can be used to induce vomiting, and after expelling water, the patient's skin will produce a little exterior sweat, allowing this floating heat to leave the body. Therefore, Zhang Zhongjing clearly considers the depth and severity of the illness; one must never attack the patient when there is internal deficiency. Thus, the master reminds us that if the purging does not stop, the patient will die. His purpose is to alert you that the patient cannot be purged due to internal deficiency.

This condition occurs in many mothers; they often create numerous problems that did not originally exist in the world, such as, \"Which is more important, the daughter-in-law or the mother?\" However, this cannot be spoken aloud, as they know it is wrong, yet they still feel compelled to display many actions. When the son comes home, the two of them hold two pairs of slippers, waiting to see which one the son will choose to wear. Over time, this leads to worry, and worry can harm the lungs. Every day, they think about trivial matters. I often say that the problems in the world are inherently simple, but people complicate them. Therefore, many people suffer from neurasthenia and often fall ill, and even after recovering from illness, they still do not feel well. When you give them Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, they may take it but then vomit; no medicine seems to work. If the illness is deeper, after a bowel movement, the patient may experience a headache, but gradually, after sixty days, they will start to improve. This indicates a deeper illness because worry can harm the lungs, and the lungs govern the po (魄) and store the po. In our blood, there are two components: one is po, and the other is hun (魂). Worry can harm the lungs, making it impossible for po to exist in the blood. Therefore, \"if there are spirits,\" it means the lung po is not secure. When the hun cannot return to the liver, it indicates that when the liver blood is damaged, a person becomes weak. In a state of deficiency of both lung qi and liver blood, this deficiency is not a true deficiency; if you give them tonifying qi or blood medicine, their body does not accept it, and they will vomit the medicine after taking it. No matter what you do, you cannot help them. When the hun is not secure, the patient cannot sleep. Human sleep requires the hun to return to the liver for a person to fall asleep. For those with neurasthenia or hysteria, if the condition is more severe, after a small bowel movement, they might exclaim, \"Wow! My head hurts a lot!\"",

Individuals suffering from neurosis or hysteria, especially in more severe cases, may experience symptoms such as, \"Wow! My head hurts a lot!\" after urinating. Why is this? It is due to insufficient body fluids. This phenomenon can often be observed after a major illness. Additionally, there are many women who worry about their children all day long or spend their time drinking afternoon tea and gossiping about others. They lack a central viewpoint and do not even know what they want themselves. Many of these individuals tend to suffer from neurosis.\n\nIn such situations, Zhang Zhongjing stated: \"If after sixty days, urination is accompanied by a headache.\" A headache during urination indicates a more severe condition, which may improve in sixty days. If \"the head does not hurt during urination, but there is a sensation of something blowing in the ears, recovery will occur in forty days.\" This sensation indicates a lighter condition. If urination is rapid and accompanied by dizziness, recovery will occur in twenty days. This is what we can observe after a major illness. This syndrome is referred to in Traditional Chinese Medicine as \"Baihe Bing\" (Lily Disease). The term \"Baihe\" signifies that it can present with a variety of symptoms or, conversely, may show no symptoms at all. You might say there is no illness, and upon examination at the hospital, it may indeed show no disease; however, the individual feels unwell throughout their body. If you are the son of such a person, you should seek me as your teacher to learn how to use Baihe Dihuang Decoction, which will help alleviate their condition.\n\nThe subsequent Baihe Dihuang syndrome is divided into several types. The first type is the pure Baihe syndrome. Another type is when the individual initially has Baihe syndrome but has been mistakenly treated with sweating, purging, or vomiting, which leads to further differentiation into four formulas. The first is the pure Baihe syndrome. \"Baihe disease does not involve vomiting, purging, or sweating; the condition remains as it was initially.\"",

Additionally, when some patients need to turn left, they must first turn around in place before they can continue walking. The feet cannot move freely, which is what 'fujue' refers to. In the classic texts, this is referred to as 'Yubu' (the steps of Yu). It is said that during his efforts to control the floods, Da Yu stood in water for many years, causing cold and dampness to invade the joints, which led to his condition. As a result, Da Yu's walking style changed, and it was previously called 'Yubu,' resembling the gait of a duck. A duck's feet do not cross over each other, and such individuals are destined for great wealth. 'Fujue' is caused by cold and dampness, with the main symptom being the inability to stop while walking; when they do stop, their body sways. At this time, one can perform acupuncture, specifically at the Chengshan point, where we typically use a long three-inch needle.\n\nWhen a lady wearing high heels accidentally falls down the stairs and injures her coccyx, if she comes to your clinic in the afternoon after injuring herself in the morning, you will notice that there are visible veins between the Weizhong and Chengshan areas, indicating that there is blood stasis. At this point, do not use acupuncture; instead, use a bloodletting needle to pierce the surface of the visible veins and let out a little blood, which will suffice. \n\n'In recent years, there are few internal medicine practitioners who can use acupuncture.' In the past, practitioners of classical formulas mostly prescribed herbal remedies and rarely used acupuncture. 'I once suffered from pain in my right arm,' Cao Yingfu previously experienced pain in his arm, from the shoulder to the Chize point, which I find quite simple to address.\"",

In my view, it is quite simple; just needling the Taiyuan point on the opposite side would resolve it. However, his daughter, Zhao Hua, treated him with a decoction of ginger and other herbs for a month before he recovered. With acupuncture, one needle would suffice. If it is a recent pain, belonging to the category of excess conditions, simply needling the Shezhe point on the opposite side of the patient would alleviate it. They do not utilize acupuncture. In the past, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners were divided into those who specialized in acupuncture and those who focused on herbal formulas, which often exhausted the patients. Treating shoulder pain with herbal washes for a month is laughable; a single needle at Shezhe could resolve it immediately. It is possible that by the time you finish preparing the medicine, the pain has already subsided, simply because they do not know how to use needles.\n\nPatients often exhibit symptoms of \"finger and arm twitching.\" For individuals with a body constitution that is weak, the prescription of Li Lu Gan Cao Decoction is indicated.\n\nLi Lu Gan Cao Decoction formula:\n[Formula details missing.]\n\nThis describes symptoms of a psychiatric disorder. If someone stands at your door, repeatedly opening and closing it, performing the same action for an hour, it can be quite alarming, appearing as if they are possessed. This is what is referred to as \"finger and arm twitching.\" Repeating a single action continuously indicates a psychiatric condition. In traditional Chinese medicine, the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders is largely attributed to phlegm obstruction and phlegm clouding the mind. Why is it that the arm cannot be controlled? Traditional Chinese medicine believes that phlegm not only accumulates in the thoracic cavity but over time, it seeps into the meridians, muscles, and joints, affecting the limbs as well. If phlegm were only in the thoracic cavity, it would be straightforward; we could simply expel it or resolve it.",

If the phlegm were only in the chest, it would be simple; we could just expel it or resolve it. However, since the phlegm is now in the meridians, we can only use the herb Li Lu.

This often occurs suddenly when exposed to cold air or when jumping into cold water, resulting in muscle cramps, which is the condition treated by Ji Shi Bai San. Nowadays, there is no need to take Ji Shi Bai San. Why was Ji Shi Bai San used in the past? The treatment philosophy of Traditional Chinese Medicine is very natural and organic. When chickens eat insects, they sometimes also consume softer rocks. After digesting these rocks, the chicken's droppings will contain a bit of yellowish-white material, which is due to the ingestion of many rocks. The calcareous substances consumed are ground in the stomach and transformed into calcium, which is then excreted. This implies that you need to consume calcium, as a deficiency in calcium can lead to muscle cramps and stiffness in the joints, which aligns with Western medical concepts. Therefore, there is no need to take Ji Shi Bai San now; instead, one should consume foods rich in calcium.\n\nFor those with Yin Hu (inguinal) hernias, there may be variations in size, with symptoms fluctuating. The remedy is Zhu Zi San (Spider Powder).",

If the patient does not exhibit exterior heat but only has floating heat within the body, feeling stuffy and heavy, with a pulse that is not very floating, and experiencing a slight fever that is not severe, what should be done? The solution is to induce a slight sweat to dispel the heat. At this time, Guadi Powder can be used to induce vomiting, and after expelling water, the patient's skin will produce a little exterior sweat, allowing the floating heat to leave the body. Therefore, Zhang Zhongjing clearly considers the depth and severity of the illness; one must never attack the body when there is internal deficiency. This is why he states that those who have continuous diarrhea will die, reminding us that patients with internal deficiency should not be attacked.

This condition occurs in many mothers; they often create numerous problems that did not originally exist in the world, such as, \"Which is more important, the daughter-in-law or the mother?\" However, this cannot be spoken aloud, as they know it is wrong, yet they still feel compelled to exhibit many behaviors. When the son comes home, the two of them hold two pairs of slippers, waiting to see which one the son will choose to wear. Over time, this leads to worry, and worry can harm the lungs. They spend each day thinking about trivial matters. I often say that the problems in the world are inherently simple, but people complicate them. As a result, many people suffer from neurasthenia and frequently fall ill, and even after recovering from an illness, they still do not feel well.

If the illness is more severe, the patient may experience headaches after urination, but gradually, after about sixty days, they will start to improve. This indicates a deeper illness, as worry can damage the lungs, which govern the po (corporeal soul) and store the po. In our blood, there are two components: one is the po, and the other is the hun (ethereal soul). Worry can harm the lungs, making it impossible for the po to exist in the blood. Therefore, \"if there are spirits,\" it means the lung po is not secure. The hun cannot return to the liver; when the liver blood is depleted, a person becomes weak. In a state of deficiency of both lung qi and liver blood, this deficiency is not a true deficiency. If you give them tonifying herbs for qi and blood, their body may not accept it, and they may vomit the medicine after taking it, making it impossible to help them. When the hun is not secure, the patient cannot sleep. Human sleep requires the hun to return to the liver for a person to fall asleep. Individuals with neurasthenia or hysteria, especially in more severe cases, may exclaim, \"Wow! My head hurts a lot!\" after urinating.",

Individuals suffering from neurasthenia or hysteria, especially in more severe cases, may experience symptoms such as, \"Wow! My head hurts a lot!\" after urinating. Why does this happen? It is due to insufficient body fluids. This condition is often observed after a major illness. Additionally, there are many women who worry about their children all day long or spend their time drinking afternoon tea and gossiping about others, lacking a central viewpoint and not knowing what they truly want. Many of these individuals tend to suffer from neurasthenia.\n\nIn such circumstances, Zhang Zhongjing stated: \"If after sixty days, urination causes headaches.\" Headaches during urination indicate a more severe condition, which may improve in sixty days. If \"the head does not hurt during urination, but there is a sensation of something blowing in the ears, recovery will occur in forty days,\" indicating a lighter condition. If urination is rapid and accompanied by dizziness, recovery will occur in twenty days. This is what we can observe after a major illness. This syndrome is referred to in TCM as \"Baihe disease.\" The term \"Baihe\" signifies a variety of symptoms, and it can also imply the absence of symptoms. You might say that a person is not ill, and upon examination at the hospital, they may indeed show no signs of illness; however, they still feel unwell throughout their body. If you are the son of such a person, you should seek me as your teacher and learn how to use Baihe Dihuang Decoction, which will help alleviate their condition.\n\nThe Baihe Dihuang syndrome can be categorized into several types. The first type is the pure Baihe syndrome. Another type is when the individual initially presents with Baihe syndrome but has been mistakenly treated with sweating, purging, or vomiting, leading to further differentiation into four formulas. The first is the pure Baihe syndrome. \"Baihe disease does not involve vomiting, purging, or sweating; the condition remains as it initially presented.\"",

Needle insertion should be two inches deep; this is an injury to the Taiyang channel.\"\n\nWhat is meant by 'foot cramp'? This is a type of walking disorder where the patient has no problem moving forward, but cannot stop; if they do stop, it feels as if they are going to fall, and they must quickly take a few steps forward to stabilize their body. Some patients, when needing to turn left, must first turn around in place before they can continue walking. The feet cannot move freely, which is what is referred to as 'foot cramp.' In the literature on physiognomy, this is called 'Yu step.' It is said that during the time of Great Yu, while managing the floods, he stood in water for many years, causing cold and dampness to invade the joints, which was the reason for his ailment. As a result, Great Yu's walking style changed, and it was previously called 'Yu step,' resembling that of a duck. A duck's feet do not cross over each other, and such individuals are destined for great wealth. 'Foot cramp' is caused by cold and dampness, with the main symptom being the inability to stop when moving forward; if they do stop, their body will sway. At this time, acupuncture can be performed, specifically at the Chengshan point, where we typically use a long three-inch needle.\n\nWhen a lady wearing high heels accidentally falls down the stairs and injures her coccyx, if she was injured in the morning and comes to your clinic in the afternoon, you will notice that there are visible veins appearing between the Weizhong and Chengshan areas, indicating that there is blood stasis. At this point, do not use acupuncture; instead, use a bloodletting needle to pierce the surface of the visible veins and let out a little blood, which will suffice. \"In recent times, there are few internal medicine practitioners who can use acupuncture.\" In the past, practitioners of classical formulas mostly prescribed herbal remedies and rarely used acupuncture.\n\n\"I once suffered from pain in my right arm,\" Cao Yingfu previously experienced pain in his arm, from the shoulder to the Chize point.

In my view, it is quite simple; just needling the Taiyuan point on the opposite side would resolve it. However, his daughter, Zhao Hua, treated him with a decoction of ginger and other herbs for a month before he recovered. With acupuncture, a single needle would have sufficed. If it is an initial pain, belonging to the category of excess syndrome, simply needling the Shezhe point on the opposite side would alleviate it. They do not utilize acupuncture. In the past, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners were divided into those who specialized in acupuncture and those who focused on herbal formulas, which often exhausted the patients. Treating shoulder pain with herbal washes for a month is laughable; a single needle at Shezhe could resolve it immediately. You might not even have finished preparing the medicine, and the condition could have already improved, simply because they do not know how to use needles.\n\nPatients often exhibit symptoms of \"finger and arm swelling and movement.\" For individuals with a body that is weak, the prescription of Li Lu Gan Cao Decoction is indicated.\n\nLi Lu Gan Cao Decoction formula:\n[Formula details missing.]\n\nThis describes the symptoms of a psychiatric patient.

In traditional Chinese medicine, the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders is largely attributed to phlegm obstruction and phlegm clouding the mind. Why is it that the arm cannot be controlled? Traditional Chinese medicine believes that phlegm not only obstructs the thoracic cavity but, over time, has seeped into the meridians, muscle tissues, and joints, not just remaining in the thoracic cavity; phlegm has infiltrated the limbs. If the phlegm were only in the thoracic cavity, it would be straightforward; we could simply expel it or resolve the phlegm.",

If the phlegm were only in the chest, it would be simple—we could just expel it or resolve it. However, now that the phlegm is in the meridians, we can only use the herb Li Lu. Li Lu resembles a long green onion, but it is longer than an onion. This prescription consists solely of Li Lu and Gan Cao (Licorice), and the elongated shape of Li Lu, which is hollow inside, indicates that after ingestion, the medicine will reach the joints of the limbs and the muscles in the meridians to clear out the phlegm. This is the Li Lu Gan Cao Decoction, and these two herbs are sufficient.\n\nAs for the condition known as \"cramping,\" the person experiences stiffness in the arms and legs, with the pulse moving up and down, slightly wiry. If the cramping extends to the abdomen, the remedy is Ji Shi Bai San (Chicken Droppings Powder).\n\n**Ji Shi Bai San Formula:**\nTake Ji Shi Bai and grind it into a powder, then mix it with water and take it warm.\n\nThe term \"cramping\" refers to muscle spasms, where the legs and arms become rigid. This often occurs suddenly when exposed to cold air or when jumping into cold water, leading to muscle cramps, which is the condition treated by Ji Shi Bai San. Nowadays, there is no need to take Ji Shi Bai San. Why was Ji Shi Bai San used in the past? The treatment philosophy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is very natural and organic. When chickens eat insects, they sometimes consume softer stones as well. After digesting these stones, the chicken's droppings will contain a bit of yellowish-white material, which is due to the ingestion of stones. When calcareous substances enter the stomach and are ground down, they become calcium and are excreted. This implies that one should consume calcium, as a deficiency in calcium can lead to muscle cramps and stiffness in the joints, which aligns with Western medical concepts. Therefore, there is no need to take Ji Shi Bai San now; instead, one should eat foods rich in calcium.\n\nFor those with Yin Hu (inguinal) hernias, there may be variations in size, with symptoms fluctuating. The remedy for this condition is Zhu Zi San (Spider Powder).",

          "english_text": "Heat is simply diagnosed in this way. When a patient suddenly experiences \"palpitations,\" it indicates a sudden onset of shortness of breath, which signifies insufficient Qi. Why does this happen? When the body is deficient, the function of the gastrointestinal system is certainly poor, and the spleen cannot generate metal (referring to the lungs). The fluids in the lungs are supplied by the pancreas and spleen; the spleen absorbs nutrients and then delivers them to the lungs. When the spleen's function is compromised, the patient will experience sudden shortness of breath, indicating a deficiency of Qi, which leads to this condition. Palpitations, in TCM, are also referred to as \"blood deficiency.\" Therefore, one is Qi deficiency, and the other is blood deficiency. Symptoms of palpitations indicate that the heart lacks strength, which causes the palpitations; in TCM, this is termed blood deficiency. The \"floating pulse\" is because the exterior of the pulse represents Qi; when you feel it, you are sensing the Qi pulse, not the blood pulse. Yang represents Qi, while blood represents Yin. When blood is insufficient, Yang rises to the surface, resulting in a pulse that feels large and floating; in reality, the patient is experiencing blood deficiency.\n\nFor men, a pulse that is weak, deep, and wiry, without signs of cold or heat, accompanied by shortness of breath, difficulty urinating, a pale complexion, occasional eye closure, and a fullness in the lower abdomen, indicates a condition caused by overexertion.\n\nHere, several symptoms unique to overexertion are presented, and the practitioner categorizes them. If a man has a \"weak, deep, wiry pulse,\" a weak pulse is one where you can feel a slight pulse, but when pressed harder, it disappears; this is called a weak pulse. Alternatively, the pulse may be very deep, only detectable near the bone, and again disappears with firm pressure. Or, the pulse may feel thin and resemble a string, which is also a weak pulse. In other words, the weak, deep, and wiry pulses all represent a deficiency of both Qi and blood. The first situation is that the patient does not exhibit signs of cold or heat. When you ask them, \"Do you feel cold? Do you feel hot?\" they respond, \"No.\" \"Shortness of breath and difficulty breathing\" means that sometimes when the patient moves a little...",

          "english_text": "There are no cold or heat phenomena. When you ask the patient, \"Do you feel cold? Do you feel hot?\" they respond, \"No.\" \"Shortness of breath and urgency\" indicates that the patient sometimes has difficulty breathing even with slight movement, and they often experience abdominal bloating and pain. \"Difficult urination\" refers to frequent urination with a small volume. \"Pale complexion\" indicates a sallow appearance. The patient often feels dizzy and may also experience \"epistaxis,\" which means they frequently have nosebleeds. Generally speaking, symptoms like difficult urination suggest that there is a problem with kidney function. A pale complexion indicates an issue with spleen function, as the complexion on our face is derived from the function of the spleen and stomach. Nosebleeds suggest that there is a problem with the liver. Why do we discuss these symptoms? The main reason is to inform everyone that when such conditions arise, it indicates that the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys are all deficient. However, upon examination, the patient may appear quite normal, yet all five organs are simultaneously deficient. This is known as \"labor syndrome,\" as \"this is caused by labor.\" These symptoms arise when there is simultaneous deficiency in the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys.\n\nIn the case of labor syndrome as a disease, the pulse is floating and large, with restlessness in the hands and feet. Symptoms are severe in spring and summer, and milder in autumn and winter. The deficiency of yin leads to the emergence of internal heat, causing soreness and weakness that prevents movement. \n\nFor patients with labor syndrome, when they become ill, their pulse is \"floating and large,\" accompanied by \"restlessness in the hands and feet,\" which indicates simultaneous restlessness in the extremities. \"Severe in spring and summer, milder in autumn and winter\" means that this restlessness worsens during the warmer months, while it improves in the colder months. This is primarily because individuals with labor syndrome inherently have yin deficiency, which causes yang to rise. When the climate is warmer in spring and summer, the internal deficiency heat interacts with the external heat from the environment, leading to discomfort for the patient. In winter, the situation improves because of the cold outside.",

          "english_text": "In comparison to heat, when the internal deficiency heat interacts with the external yang heat, the patient feels very uncomfortable. In winter, this condition tends to improve because the cold outside can restrain the heat. Additionally, individuals with severe labor syndrome may experience the phenomenon of \"yin cold essence spontaneously emerging.\"\n\nZhang Zhongjing simply explained that most people suffering from labor syndrome have heat above and cold below; that is, the area above the navel is hot, while the area below is cold. The navel serves as the boundary between yin and yang. The lower part is characterized by yin cold, which signifies a lack of dynamic energy and a cessation of peristalsis, leading to poor metabolism. Conversely, the upper part is excessively hot and overly exuberant. In a healthy individual, yin is above and yang is below, which prevents yang from floating upwards, allowing our dynamic energy to be concealed, referred to as \"hidden yang.\" In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), it is not the quantity of yang that matters, but rather its ability to remain concealed.\n\nTherefore, if a patient has yang heat above that cannot descend, this heat will rise to the extremities. At this time, the lower jiao becomes a gathering place for yin cold, leading to \"essence spontaneously emerging.\" The patient may exhibit several symptoms; for men, this may manifest as nocturnal emissions or dreams of sexual intercourse. Older individuals often experience spontaneous essence leakage due to yang deficiency, which they cannot control, resulting in involuntary loss of essence. This symptom is very distressing, but can be quickly treated with herbal medicine.\n\nFurthermore, \"soreness and weakness preventing movement\" occurs because the lower jiao is deficient and cold, causing essence to leak out. Women do not have essence, but when this phenomenon occurs in females, there may be excessive vaginal discharge that continuously drips, leading to a depletion of energy. When this happens, it can affect sleep at night. Since the kidneys govern the bones,",

The differentiation here describes the symptoms that a patient will exhibit when there is a deficiency of body fluids in the lungs, so thirst is a primary distinguishing symptom; in Yangming syndrome, there must be thirst. The expectoration of turbid phlegm indicates that the mucus in the bronchial tubes is continuously being expelled. \"Constantly shivering from the cold, heat causes the blood to stagnate,\" indicates that it is too hot; excessively hot blood can also lead to blood stasis, hence it becomes stagnant. At this point, the virus residing in the lungs will gradually erode some of the alveoli and tissues within the lungs, and when the tissues necrose, they will become purulent. Initially, the sputum will be \"like rice porridge,\" meaning that the phlegm expelled resembles white rice porridge. The so-called rice porridge refers to a pneumonia patient who spits out phlegm on the ground; after two or three hours, this phlegm will turn into a large mass of foam because it is filled with viruses. \"When pus forms, death follows,\" means that the expelled phlegm, resembling a blood clot, will sink when dropped into water. If it floats on the surface, it is not toxic; this is a property of the substance. If the phlegm sinks to the bottom of the water, it indicates how severe the toxicity is. If you say, \"Teacher, Zhang Zhongjing said that when pus forms, death follows, so we should not treat it and just wait to see if the patient will die?\" Although Zhang Zhongjing said this, he still prescribed treatments. Therefore, everyone now understands that when heat accumulates in the lungs for too long and cannot be completely eliminated, one day it will transform into this condition, which in modern Western medicine is referred to as lung cancer.\n\nShortness of breath, facial edema, shoulder breathing, and a pulse that is floating and large—if untreated, it will worsen, especially with diarrhea.

This fundamentally represents a terminal condition. Why is it considered terminal? The swelling of the face signifies what we refer to as \"Yang deficiency.\" When Yang is deficient, the Yang energy rises upwards. If there is no treatment when it reaches the lungs, the Yang energy will surge to the head and face, causing facial swelling. \"Shoulder breathing\" indicates that the patient's respiratory system is failing; the heart and lungs are on the verge of exhaustion, and the patient must move their shoulders to take a deep breath because breathing has become difficult. If at this time the patient's pulse becomes very floating, large, and robust, it signifies that Yang has escaped. These phenomena occur when the body's kinetic energy and spirit are about to leave the body, indicating an incurable condition. \n\nIf there is \"increased diarrhea,\" with the patient experiencing incontinence of both urine and feces, it indicates that Yin has also become deficient. After Yang deficiency leads to Yin deficiency, this naturally results in a terminal condition. Therefore, when we see a patient with Yang energy rising, their face flushed, while simultaneously experiencing diarrhea, these are very dangerous symptoms, indicating that the internal organs are no longer receiving nourishment from food or medicine. Why is this considered a certain terminal condition? Because at this point, all kinetic energy is moving upwards, and the patient has lost even the peristalsis of the gastrointestinal tract.

          "english_text": "\"Shortness of breath and dryness\" is referred to as \"lung distension.\" In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), lung distension clinically corresponds to what Western medicine describes as emphysema. There are many causes of emphysema, such as living near factories, particularly cotton or carpet factories, where there is a lot of cotton fluff, or residing in areas with polluted air, like near coal factories. In the past, many miners developed emphysema due to the unclean air they were exposed to. Additionally, teachers who frequently write on blackboards can inhale chalk dust, which can also lead to emphysema. Here, lung distension is essentially modern emphysema. \n\nThe main symptom of lung distension is a persistent state of inhalation, where the patient is unable to exhale. After inhalation, the patient's lungs can expand but do not contract to expel the air, resulting in a feeling of fullness in that area, making inhalation become very shallow. Zhang Zhongjing provided two prescriptions for treatment: the first is for patients with lung distension who can still lie flat; this is one prescription. If the patient can no longer lie flat, a different prescription is used. Although this is a brief passage, it is written in great detail, and further elaboration will be provided in the section on Feng Shui.\n\nLung atrophy, characterized by the expulsion of phlegm without coughing, indicates that the person does not feel thirsty and will likely experience frequent urination. This occurs because the deficiency above cannot control the downward flow. This condition is associated with cold in the lungs, which leads to dizziness and excessive phlegm. The prescription for this is Gan Cao (Licorice) and Gan Jiang (Dried Ginger) Decoction to warm the lungs. If the patient feels thirsty after taking the decoction, it is classified as diabetes.\n\nGan Cao and Gan Jiang Decoction:\n- Licorice: 4 taels (roasted)\n- Dried Ginger: 2 taels (processed)\n\nCrush the above ingredients, add 3 sheng (approximately 9 cups) of water, and boil down to 1 sheng and 5 he (approximately 1.5 cups). Strain and take the warm decoction in divided doses.\n\nNow that you have an understanding of lung atrophy, it can be simply described as lung deficiency. Lung abscess, on the other hand, indicates lung excess; deficiency should be tonified, while excess should be drained. If it is lung atrophy,",

          "english_text": "Water disease patients exhibit several characteristics. The first is \"the presence of sleeping silkworms under the eyes,\" which refers to the swelling of the bags under the eyes, appearing somewhat translucent, indicating that the person has a water disease. According to divination texts, if the bags under the eyes are swollen and glossy, resembling pearls, and this occurs on the left side, it signifies a wealthy son; if on the right side, it signifies a wealthy daughter. One must not mistake this for edema. The second characteristic is \"a fresh and lustrous complexion,\" where the face appears very shiny, which is actually the color of accumulated water. The third phenomenon is \"hidden pulse,\" as all water disease pulses are bound to be hidden pulses, due to the excess water pressing down on the blood vessels. The fourth phenomenon is \"the person suffers from thirst due to water disease,\" where individuals with water disease will definitely experience thirst, drinking water but being unable to urinate, resulting in \"abdominal distension,\" where the belly becomes swollen, and \"difficult urination.\" Our body's water excretion system consists of urination and sweating. If this person can sweat and urinate, they will not experience edema, and it is not classified as water disease, but rather as thirst. \"If the pulse is deep and absent, there is water, and it can be purged.\" The principle of treating water disease is that above the navel, we use sweating methods, and below the navel, we use diuretic methods. In such cases, if urination is difficult and bowel movements are also obstructed, this condition corresponds to the diagnosis of Da Huang Fu Zi Xi Xin Tang.\n\nA question arises: After experiencing diarrhea, if one is thirsty and drinks water, but urination is difficult and the abdomen is distended due to swelling, what is the reason? The answer is: This method should address water disease; if urination is self-sufficient and sweating occurs, recovery is expected. \n\nAfter a person experiences diarrhea, the normal state is that the fluids in the stomach and intestines are depleted, leading to thirst and a desire to drink water, hence \"thirsty for water.\" As a result, \"if urination is difficult and the abdomen is distended due to swelling,\" it means that after drinking water, urination is obstructed, causing the entire abdomen to swell. Why is this so? Zhang Zhongjing said...",
