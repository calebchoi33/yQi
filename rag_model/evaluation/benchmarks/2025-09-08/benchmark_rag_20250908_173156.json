          "english_text": "In clinical practice, when observing patients, if the patient is already very weak but continues to sweat, it indicates that the patient's skin cannot consolidate the exterior. The person's vital energy (yuanqi), original yang (yuanyang), and spirit are all being lost, with high-protein substances continuously leaking out, resulting in a complete loss of physical strength. If there is \"pain in the throat, it indicates obstruction in the throat,\" meaning that the virus has migrated to the throat, causing pain. If there is \"fever without sweating, the diarrhea must stop,\" it means that the heat cannot dissipate and will descend; thus, the diarrhea must cease. \"If it does not stop, it will lead to pus and blood,\" indicating that hepatitis-related substances have emerged, causing throat pain. If it does not descend to the throat, the diarrhea will result in pus and blood; \"if there is pus and blood, the throat will not be obstructed.\" Therefore, if there is pus and blood, the throat will not hurt. The inflammatory filterable virus cannot be eliminated by traditional Chinese medicine, nor can the immune system eradicate it; it must have an outlet. When it exits, it can do so through diarrhea or by moving upwards, and one must find every possible way to expel the filterable virus.\n\nRegarding \"Shanghan\" (cold damage), within one to two days, up to four to five days, if there is an initial fainting, there must be fever; if there is initial fever followed by fainting, the fainting will be deep and the fever also deep; if the fainting is mild, the fever will also be mild. Fainting should be treated by descending methods, and if sweating is induced inappropriately, it will lead to mouth sores and redness.\n\nThis section corresponds to the previous diagnostic criteria. Zhang Zhongjing's intention is that if one enters the Jueyin syndrome and experiences the exterior symptoms of wind-cold, it is crucial to remember that the interior has already become deficient, and the gastrointestinal fluids are insufficient. In the case of insufficient gastrointestinal fluids, one must not induce sweating, as the source of sweat is the fluids from the gastrointestinal tract. Inducing sweat inappropriately can cause the mucus from the liver to manifest in the mouth. When experiencing a cold or fever, sweating can be used for resolution; however, in the case of Jueyin syndrome, sweating should not be used for resolution, as the filterable virus resides in the liver.",

          "english_text": "Here is the translation of the provided Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) text:\n\n---\n\nThe condition has arrived. When experiencing a cold with fever, sweating can be used to resolve it. However, if it is a case of Jueyin syndrome, sweating should not be used. In Jueyin syndrome, filtered viruses reside in the liver, and sweating from the skin is unrelated to the liver; instead, it further damages the fluids of the gastrointestinal tract and harms the immune system.\n\n351. \"In cases of cold damage,\" if there is Jue (a state of cold) for five days and heat for five days, if on the sixth day the Jue does not return, the patient will recover spontaneously. Jue does not last more than five days, and heat lasts for five days; hence, it is known that spontaneous recovery occurs.\n\nIf a person has been in a coma for five days and has had heat for five days, by the sixth day they should feel cold. If the patient does not feel cold, it indicates that the illness is improving, which signifies that the stomach qi has been restored, and thus they will not feel cold.\n\n352. In any case of Jue, the yin and yang qi are not harmoniously connected, resulting in Jue. Jue is characterized by coldness in the hands and feet.\n\nJue refers to the hands and feet being cold up to the elbows and knees. The disharmony of yin and yang qi indicates an obstruction in blood circulation. When blood circulation is smooth, a person feels warm; when it is obstructed, and the heart is weakened, the person may fall into a coma.\n\n353. \"In cases of cold damage,\" the pulse is weak and there is Jue. After seven or eight days, the skin feels cold, and the person is restless, unable to find peace; this is called concealed Jue. It is different from the Jue caused by parasites.\n\n354. In cases of parasitic Jue, the person often vomits parasites. In the current patient, there is stillness, but they become agitated at times; this is parasitic Jue. The parasites ascend and enter the diaphragm, causing agitation, which may cease momentarily. If the person eats and then vomits and feels agitated, it is because the parasites sense the smell of food and will cause the person to vomit them. For parasitic Jue, \"Wu Mei Wan\" is the main treatment, and it is also indicated for prolonged diarrhea.\n\nThe patient exhibits signs of agitation, with a weak pulse, and both Shaoyin and Jueyin symptoms are present. In Shaoyin syndrome, agitation and inability to lie down persist continuously, while in Jueyin syndrome, agitation may fluctuate between periods of restlessness and calm. This is a case of organ Jue, which is different from parasitic Jue. \"In parasitic Jue, the person often vomits parasites,\" indicating that the parasites are expelled from the mouth.\n\n--- \n\nThis translation maintains the technical terminology and concepts of Traditional Chinese Medicine while accurately conveying the original meaning.",

          "english_text": "If the illness occurs at night, it is considered to arise from Yin, and it is only during the day that it begins to be counted. Therefore, the day after the onset of the illness is regarded as the first day. It takes a full six days, and by the midnight of the sixth day, the illness will resolve on its own, hence the saying \"healing in six days.\" Regardless of whether it is a Yin or Yang illness, if one catches a cold, it is expected to resolve in six days under normal circumstances. Thus, if one does not take medication for a cold, it will typically improve within a week.\n\nThe terms \"Yin\" and \"Yang\" have broad interpretations. When distinguishing between cold and heat, cold is classified as \"Yin\" and heat as \"Yang.\" When differentiating between exterior and interior, the exterior is \"Yang\" and the interior is \"Yin.\" When categorizing organs, the solid organs are \"Yin\" and the hollow organs are \"Yang.\" When considering upper and lower, the upper is \"Yang\" and the lower is \"Yin.\" When looking at left and right, the left is \"Yang\" and the right is \"Yin.\" When dividing by Qi and blood, Qi is \"Yang\" and blood is \"Yin.\" When assessing deficiency and excess, deficiency is \"Yin\" and excess is \"Yang.\" Additionally, substances such as bodily secretions, moisture, and plasma are referred to as \"Yin,\" while intangible aspects such as the body's resistance, cellular metabolism, and the natural functions of various organs are referred to as \"Yang.\"\n\nRegarding \"Taiyang disease,\" if there is a headache that resolves on its own after seven days, it is due to the completion of its meridian. If one wishes to induce another cycle, one can needle the \"Foot Yangming\" point to prevent the meridian from transmitting, thus facilitating recovery.\n\nFor headaches, if they resolve on their own, they typically improve within a week. If a cold has not improved by the seventh day, it is advisable to see a doctor promptly. In the case of Taiyang disease, it may sometimes transmit to Yangming or Shaoyang, or transition from Yangming to Shaoyang, or from Shaoyang to Yangming; this is not fixed. If Taiyang disease has not yet reached the Foot Yangming stage, needling the primary point of Foot Yangming, \"Zusanli\" (ST36), will prevent the transmission.",

Consequently, the source of essence and blood is insufficient, resulting in the phenomenon of the patient wanting to sleep but being unable to do so. **\"Eyes closed, then sweating\"** indicates that when the eyes are shut, there is sweating, which is a sign of significant deficiency. Normally, sweating occurs during exercise or after physical activity; however, if the patient sweats even while lying down, it signifies a continuous loss of body fluids.

Da Chai Hu Tang contains Da Huang (Rhubarb), which can simultaneously resolve the concurrent diseases of Shaoyang and Yangming.\n\n**In the case of \"Shanghan\" (Cold Damage)**: After six to seven days, if there is no significant fever and the patient is irritable, this is due to the Yang retreating into Yin. \n\nAccording to the principle, \"Shanghan for six to seven days, with no significant fever,\" the phenomenon of fever has disappeared, and there is no longer a fever. However, if \"the person is irritable,\" this indicates that the patient's condition has progressed from the exterior to the interior. \"This is due to Yang retreating into Yin,\" where Yang represents the exterior and Yin represents the interior. Therefore, the retreat of Yang into Yin does not necessarily mean it has entered the Yin organs; it can also indicate a transition from Shaoyang syndrome to Yangming syndrome, which can also cause irritability.\n\n**In the case of \"Shanghan\"**: After three days, when the three Yangs have been exhausted, the three Yins should be susceptible to pathogens. If the person can eat without vomiting, this indicates that the three Yins are not affected by pathogens. \n\nAfter three days of Shanghan, or more than half a month, after twenty-one days, when the three Yangs have been exhausted, the three Yins should be susceptible to pathogens. If the illness progresses into the Shaoyang and Yangming phases and is not treated effectively, it should enter the Yin organs. However, if \"the person can eat without vomiting,\" it indicates a reversal, where the patient can still consume food without experiencing nausea.",

          "english_text": "The patient has neither exterior nor interior symptoms, no chills or fever, and normal bowel movements. However, the pulse is floating and rapid; the floating pulse indicates an exterior condition, while the rapid pulse signifies heat. Yet, the patient does not exhibit any symptoms, so we will not concern ourselves with this for now; it is not a problem. \"If it has already been resolved,\" meaning if the condition has been addressed, \"and the pulse is rapid, but there is no bowel movement, it indicates the presence of blood stasis, and the appropriate remedy is Di Dang Tang.\" If the condition has been resolved but the pulse remains large and there are still issues with bowel movements, it indicates blood stasis, and Di Dang Tang should be used. \"If the pulse is rapid, there is no resolution, and the diarrhea does not stop, it must be associated with heat, leading to purulent blood in the stool.\" If blood appears in the stool, it could be due to hemorrhoids, possibly internal hemorrhoids, especially in women who have given birth without surgery; most cases are internal hemorrhoids. Clinically, there are more women with hemorrhoids than men. Pressing on \"Kong Zui\" or \"Cheng Shan\" will reveal tender points indicative of hemorrhoids. Another cause of purulent blood in the stool is excessive heat in the blood, with insufficient fluids in the blood. Once the blood becomes too hot, it will deviate from its normal pathways, causing blood vessels to rupture, leading to blood entering the bowels. Therefore, when blood appears in the stool, and there is purulent blood, Bai Tou Weng Tang can be used.\n\n273. \"In the case of cold damage,\" after sweating has been induced, the body and eyes turn yellow. This occurs because the cold and dampness within have not been resolved. It is believed that purging is not appropriate, as one seeks to address the cold and dampness internally. \n\nThe patient originally has cold damage; if it were purely cold damage, Ma Huang Tang would suffice to induce sweating. However, the patient has dampness inside. When Ma Huang Tang induces sweating, it only addresses the exterior symptoms, but the internal dampness remains. Dampness is related to the spleen, which is associated with the earth element and is characterized by a yellowish hue, indicating a deficiency of yang. Sweating is derived from the fluids of the gastrointestinal tract, and because sweating mobilizes the internal dampness, it leads to the appearance of yellow. In cases of cold dampness, the formulas \"Zhu Fu Tang\" and \"Wu Ling San\" can be used to dispel cold and dampness. \n\n274. \"In the case of cold damage...\"",

When observing blood in the blood vessels, it is red, but when viewed through a layer of skin, the color of the blood appears yellow. This indicates that the water in the blood has been depleted. What is seen through the skin is the color of the blood, so this type of yellowing is not due to liver or gallbladder disease; do not confuse it. This yellowing is caused by dehydration. In severe cases, when the body has lost too much fluid, the brain does not receive adequate blood for nourishment, which can lead to convulsions. The liver governs the tendons, and the tendons rely on blood for nourishment. Without sufficient blood supply, cramps will occur, leading to spasms that tighten and then release repeatedly.

In cases of \"Shang Han\" (cold damage), if there is vomiting or diarrhea, and after seven to eight days there is no resolution, with heat accumulating internally, both the exterior and interior are hot, with occasional sweating, aversion to wind, great thirst, and agitation, the tongue is dry, and the patient desires to drink several sheng of water, \"Bai Hu Jia Ren Shen Tang\" (White Tiger Decoction with Ginseng) is indicated.\n\nIn cases of Shang Han, the exterior and sweating methods should be used. However, after vomiting and diarrhea, the stomach's fluids will definitely be harmed. If there is no improvement after seven to eight days, it results in \"heat accumulating internally, both the exterior and interior are hot.\" There is illness inside, and there is illness outside. Where does the internal heat come from? It is because the fluids have been harmed; the heat in the body is trapped within the fluids and also within the blood. A portion of the heat, after the fluids are harmed, leaves the fluids and the blood and rises to the surface, causing internal heat. The first organ to be affected is the lung, which governs the skin and hair. At this time, the patient often feels sweaty, fears the wind, experiences great thirst and agitation. When the upper jiao (the upper burner) is too dry and hot, it is because the fluids are gone; the upper jiao is like the sky without clouds, with the sun shining directly, making it very hot. This is the pattern of Bai Hu Tang (White Tiger Decoction), as the yang of the chest is above, and the heart and lungs have a certain level of moisture. The chest is already very hot, and the heat from the stomach rises, with all the fluids lost and sweated out. As a result, the \"tongue is dry,\" the tongue protrudes with no saliva, and it can be severe enough that the tongue coating turns upward. \"Desiring to drink several sheng of water\" indicates thirst; even after drinking for a long time, the thirst cannot be quenched because the water goes into the stomach and moves downward, but the body cannot absorb it. The water that is truly absorbed relies on the gastric fluids to resolve it, but the gastric fluids have been completely vomited out and are no longer present.",

The person's vital energy (yuanqi), original yang (yuanyang), and spirit are all being lost, as high-protein substances are continuously flowing out, resulting in a complete loss of physical strength. If there is \"pain in the throat, it indicates obstruction in the throat,\" meaning that the virus has migrated to the throat, causing pain. If there is \"fever without sweating, the diarrhea must stop,\" it means that the heat cannot dissipate and will descend; thus, the diarrhea must cease. \"If it does not stop, it will lead to pus and blood,\" indicating that hepatitis-related issues have manifested in the throat, resulting in throat pain. If it does not descend to the throat, the diarrhea will lead to pus and blood; \"if there is pus and blood, the throat will not be obstructed.\" Therefore, if there is pus and blood, the throat will not hurt. The inflammatory filtrable virus cannot be eliminated by traditional Chinese medicine or the immune system; it must have an outlet. When it exits, it can do so through diarrhea or by moving upwards, and one must find ways to expel the filtrable virus.\n\nIn the case of \"cold damage,\" lasting one to two days, up to four to five days, if there is an initial fainting episode, there will definitely be a fever; if there is initial fever followed by fainting, the fainting will be deep and the heat will also be deep; if the fainting is mild, the heat will also be mild. Fainting should be treated by descending the heat, but if one mistakenly induces sweating, it will definitely lead to mouth sores and redness.\n\nThis section corresponds to the previous diagnostic criteria. Zhang Zhongjing's intention is that if one enters the Jueyin syndrome and experiences the exterior symptoms of wind-cold, it is crucial to remember that the interior has already become deficient, and the gastrointestinal fluids are insufficient. In the case of insufficient gastrointestinal fluids, one must not induce sweating, as the source of sweat is the fluids from the gastrointestinal tract. Mistakenly inducing sweat can lead to mouth sores and redness, as it will bring the mucus from the liver to the mouth. When experiencing a cold or fever, sweating can be used for resolution; however, in the case of Jueyin syndrome, sweating should not be used for resolution, as the filtrable virus resides in the liver.",

          "english_text": "Here is the translation of the provided Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) text:\n\n---\n\nThe condition has arrived. When experiencing a cold with fever, sweating is used to resolve it. However, if it is a case of Jueyin syndrome, sweating should not be used. In Jueyin syndrome, filtered viruses reside in the liver, and sweating from the skin is unrelated to the liver; instead, it further damages the fluids of the gastrointestinal tract and harms the immune system.\n\nSection 351: \"In cases of cold damage,\" if there is Jue (a state of cold) for five days and heat for five days, if it persists into the sixth day without returning to Jue, the patient will recover on their own. Jue does not last more than five days, and heat lasts for five days; hence, it is known that self-recovery is possible.\n\nIf a person has been in a coma for five days and has had heat for five days, by the sixth day, they should feel cold. If the patient does not feel cold, it indicates that the illness is improving, which signifies the restoration of stomach qi, and thus they will not feel cold anymore.\n\nSection 352: Any state of Jue occurs when the yin and yang qi do not connect harmoniously, resulting in Jue. Jue is characterized by coldness in the hands and feet.\n\nJue refers to the hands and feet being cold up to the elbows and knees. The disharmony of yin and yang qi indicates an obstruction in blood circulation. When blood circulation is smooth, the person feels warm; when it is obstructed, especially when the heart is weakened, the person may become comatose.\n\nSection 353: In \"cold damage,\" the pulse is weak and there is Jue. After seven or eight days, the skin feels cold, and the person is restless, unable to find peace; this is known as concealed Jue, which is different from the Jue caused by parasites.\n\nSection 354: In cases of parasitic Jue, the person often vomits parasites. In the current patient, they are quiet but then become agitated; this indicates parasitic Jue. The parasites ascend to the diaphragm, causing agitation, which may stop momentarily. If they eat and then vomit again, feeling agitated, it is because the parasites sense the smell of food and will likely cause the person to vomit parasites. For parasitic Jue, \"Wu Mei Wan\" is the main treatment, and it also addresses prolonged diarrhea.\n\nPatients exhibiting signs of agitation, with a weak pulse, may present with Shaoyin and Jueyin symptoms. In Shaoyin syndrome, agitation and inability to lie down persist continuously, while in Jueyin syndrome, agitation may fluctuate between being agitated and calm; this is a case of organ Jue, which is different from parasitic Jue. \"In cases of parasitic Jue, the person often vomits parasites,\" indicating that the parasites are expelled from the mouth.\n\n--- \n\nThis translation maintains the technical terminology and concepts of Traditional Chinese Medicine while ensuring clarity in the English language.",

This indicates the onset of \"jaundice,\" and even if purged, the abdomen remains distended; this is primarily due to the slow pulse.\n\nYangming disease pertains to gastrointestinal issues. A \"slow pulse\" indicates a deficiency in the stomach. If the pulse is rapid, it typically suggests inflammation within or a blockage in the intestines. If the pulse is rapid, one might inquire about bowel movements. If the response is affirmative and accompanied by diarrhea, it indicates the presence of deficient heat. \"Difficulty in achieving satiety\" means that even a small amount of food leads to a feeling of fullness. \"Slight agitation when full, dizziness, and difficulty in urination\" suggest the onset of \"jaundice.\" The majority of these symptoms arise from insufficient digestive secretions from the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas, leading to poor digestion in the gastrointestinal tract, which becomes deficient and cold. \"Slight agitation when full\" indicates that the contents in the stomach cannot be digested; the food remains distended in the stomach, causing a feeling of mild discomfort. Why does dizziness occur? After eating, nutrients are primarily supplied to the brain. If the stomach is deficient and cold, food cannot be digested, and there is no nutrient supply to the head, leading to symptoms of ischemia, hence the dizziness. When the digestive system is not functioning properly, urination will also be abnormal; \"difficulty in urination\" does not necessarily refer to the volume being too much or too little, but rather the frequency may be high with little output, or only a few drops may be produced. Poor digestion, due to inadequate spleen function, leads to an accumulation of dampness, which tends to descend. Generally speaking, dampness settles in the lower jiao, causing abdominal distension. If there is excessive dampness causing a blockage, urination will naturally decrease. If urination is normal, it indicates that dampness has...",

Therefore, sometimes when you eat in the morning, you may still taste the morning's food when you burp in the evening, but this is a normal situation. \n\nHowever, if one day the stomach's function has problems and cannot push out the old food, the retained food becomes obstructed in this area, which Traditional Chinese Medicine refers to as \"retained filth,\" meaning dirty substances are blocked inside. In the state of having retained filth, the stomach's function naturally deteriorates. Additionally, if the patient enjoys drinking cold beverages, the cold drinks or foods consumed can cause cold dampness to block this area, while hot foods do not have this effect. Cold foods inside will slow down gastrointestinal peristalsis, leading to obstruction, ultimately resulting in water retention in the diaphragm area. This fluid contains cold dampness and is caused by some retained food being blocked inside. \n\nAt this time, if you use X-ray imaging, it will not be visible because it is not cancer or a tumor, but rather retained food.

The thirty-six diseases manifest in countless variations; one must carefully examine the pulse for yin and yang, deficiency and excess, and tightness of the pulse. Administering acupuncture and herbal medicine can stabilize the condition, and although the symptoms may appear similar, the pulse varies in origin. One must discern and document these differences; do not assume otherwise.\n\nThis section is for your reference. \"Women's diseases\" generally stem from three causes: one is \"deficiency\" in the body, another is \"accumulated cold,\" as young women tend to enjoy cold foods, which can exacerbate their inherent deficiency and heat. The third cause is \"stagnation of qi,\" where unresolved emotional issues lead to daily anger without understanding the reasons behind it. \"When the menstrual flow is obstructed for years,\" this can result in menstruation ceasing for one or two years, leading to \"cold blood accumulating at the uterine orifice,\" with stasis of blood and cold conditions forming clots in the uterus. In severe cases, cold can damage the meridians; if \"the stagnation is located above,\" and the cold blood coagulates near the liver area, the patient may experience \"vomiting\" and \"salivation.\" Over time, this can develop into \"chronic pulmonary atrophy.\" The liver is partially above and partially below the diaphragm, and its channels directly connect to the entire area surrounding the lungs, which can lead to a sensation of fullness in the chest and result in \"physical deterioration,\" causing the patient to become increasingly emaciated. \"If there is a blockage in the middle burner, resulting in cold hernia around the navel, or pain in both sides of the ribs,\" if the obstruction is located in the middle jiao, which includes the liver, gallbladder, spleen, and stomach, it can lead to pain around the navel and abdominal pain or pain below the ribs. \"If it connects with the organs or accumulates heat in the middle, pain will be felt at the lower abdomen.\" If it is in contact with the uterus or obstructs the Ren meridian...",

          "english_text": "This refers to the spleen and stomach. When our intestines and stomach absorb food, the \"liver and gallbladder fluids seep into the stomach.\" Inside the stomach, there are three components: the sourness from the liver, the bitterness from the gallbladder, and the sweetness from the spleen along with the mucus from the pancreas. If it is too cold, and our liver is affected by cold, we will vomit sour bile. Therefore, when experiencing sour vomiting, we use drying methods to stop the vomiting. If a patient vomits sour bile, it indicates that the liver fluids are being expelled, and we treat this with Wu Zhu Yu Decoction. If there is heat in the liver, then bile will be vomited, resulting in a bitter taste. \"Teacher, why do I wake up in the morning with a bitter mouth?\" This is due to bile rising, which corresponds to the Xiao Chai Hu Decoction syndrome. You are all quite familiar with this now. If the bitterness is severe, we need to increase the dosage of Huang Qin in Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, and also increase Ban Xia. Ban Xia can descend the rebellious qi and stop vomiting, meaning that when bile rises, we need to use Ban Xia to bring it down. Thus, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction can harmonize the stomach qi. \"When dampness prevails, the liver and gallbladder become unbalanced.\" One of the most difficult concepts for people to understand in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is \"qi.\" What exactly is qi? Western medicine cannot see qi; it only observes the circulatory system, whether it is the lymphatic system or the blood circulation system. Western medicine does not recognize that it is qi that drives this circulatory system; its driving force is what TCM refers to as qi. If the qi of the liver and gallbladder is not sufficient, it means that the driving force of the liver and gallbladder is inadequate. The liver itself is the largest detoxifying organ in our body, and Western medicine acknowledges this as well. When we consume many substances, if liver function is not normal, the metabolic system will not function well, resulting in an inability to fully perform detoxification. In TCM, this condition is referred to as \"stagnation.\" Qi stagnation occurs in the liver, preventing it from moving properly. Normally, our body circulates blood throughout, along with residual substances...",

Their problems cannot be resolved by themselves, yet their minds wander into imagining many issues that do not exist in the world, questions that have no answers. Naturally, thinking about these half-formed ideas cannot lead to solutions. Therefore, I often tell my patients: \"When you come to my clinic, your illness is my concern, not yours. Your responsibility is to take care of your wife and children, to do your job well, and to manage your home. Daydreaming about these issues is of no use.\" Patients do not understand medicine; they spend a long time just thinking. If \"thinking\" could cure diseases, then it would be fine to think, but such thoughts do not help and instead increase the burden on the physician. Thus, we often find ourselves treating conditions like splenomegaly, gastric ptosis, kidney diseases, or strokes, while the patient still suffers from emotional distress. In the process of treatment, we also need to address their emotional issues, which leads to more complications.

The 69th entry describes a situation after taking Ma Huang Tang, where the chest yang has diminished, leading to the sensation of heart palpitations below the heart. The 70th entry refers to excessive sweating from Gui Zhi Tang, resulting in a depletion of the stomach and intestines' fluids, causing insufficient water, which leads to a twitching sensation around the navel, indicating a preparation for the condition known as \"ben tun\" (running piglet syndrome).\n\nIn Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), heart palpitations below the heart do not refer to the heart racing as seen clinically, but rather to the area around \"Zhong Wan\" (the middle abdomen) pulsating. This occurs because the heavenly yang above has dried up, causing the fluids to be drawn upwards, leading to a blockage at \"Zhong Wan.\" At this time, \"Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang\" (Cinnamon Twig and Licorice Decoction) is used.\n\nIt is important to have a conceptual understanding: the area around the navel is associated with different organs— the center of the navel corresponds to the spleen, above the navel corresponds to the kidneys, below the navel corresponds to the heart, the left side of the navel corresponds to the liver, and the right side corresponds to the lungs. For example, if there are palpitations above the navel, treatment should focus on the kidneys, and similarly for other areas.\n\nGui Zhi Gan Cao Tang formula:\n- Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig) 4 liang (approximately 150 grams, peeled)\n- Gan Cao (Licorice) 2 liang (approximately 75 grams, roasted)\n\nCombine these two ingredients with 3 sheng (approximately 900 ml) of water, boil down to 1 sheng (approximately 300 ml), strain, and take it in one dose.\n\nIf using 4 qian (approximately 15 grams) of Gui Zhi, then use 2 qian (approximately 7.5 grams) of Gan Cao, as Gui Zhi is twice the amount of Gan Cao. This is because excessive sweating has occurred, and Gan Cao replenishes the stomach's fluids. \n\nWhy use Gui Zhi and not Bai Shao (White Peony)? Why do palpitations occur? When drinking water, the stomach is very warm; when water enters the stomach, it vaporizes and becomes steam, not just water. If the water is stagnant at \"Zhong Wan,\" Gui Zhi, being very warm, will cause the water to evaporate upwards.

What does \"a person in a normal state has no cold or heat\" mean? It refers to a person who does not have any particular aversion to cold or heat, meaning there are no symptoms of cold or heat. Suddenly feeling as if one cannot breathe, along with \"insufficient for respiration,\" indicates very short breaths. From this point, we can determine that something is obstructing the flow, which signifies an excess condition. This is the method to differentiate between deficiency and excess. In the section on chest obstruction, we introduce treatments for deficiency conditions, with no treatments for excess conditions.\n\nThe disease of chest obstruction includes symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, chest and back pain, and shortness of breath. The pulse at the cun position is deep and slow, while the guan position is tight and rapid. The prescription for this condition is Guo Lou Xie Bai Bai Jiu Tang (Bottle Gourd, Chinese Chives, and White Wine Decoction).\n\nGuo Lou Xie Bai Bai Jiu Tang formula:\nOne piece of ripe bottle gourd, half a jin of Chinese chives, and seven sheng of white wine. \n\nCombine these three ingredients, boil them together, and take two sheng, dividing it into warm doses for consumption.\n\nThis is a very light prescription. When a patient experiences \"chest and back pain,\" it means that sometimes the chest pain radiates to the back, and sometimes the back pain feels like it penetrates to the front of the chest. However, it is not as intense as heart pain that radiates through the back; it is merely a slight, lingering pain. This is caused by the stagnation of Yang Qi in the chest, hence it is the lightest formula, Guo Lou Xie Bai Bai Jiu Tang. The ripe bottle gourd resembles a loofah; if you cut it horizontally in the middle, it looks like a tomato. This gourd is used in medicine, and you cut it into segments from the middle. If we use its root, it is called Guo Lou Gen, also known as Tian Hua Fen. The ripe bottle gourd refers to using its fruit for medicinal purposes. When you go to the pharmacy to buy it, you might see it and think, \"Hey, teacher, this looks like the heart's ventricles and atria.\" When viewed from the front, it appears this way, and there are seeds inside.

          "english_text": "Heat is simply diagnosed in this manner. When a patient suddenly experiences \"palpitations,\" it indicates a sudden onset of shortness of breath, which signifies insufficient Qi. Why does this happen? When the body is deficient, the function of the gastrointestinal system must be poor; the spleen cannot generate metal (referring to the lungs), and the fluids in the lungs are supplied by the pancreas and spleen. The spleen absorbs nutrients and then delivers them to the lungs. When the spleen's function is compromised, the patient will experience sudden shortness of breath, indicating a deficiency of Qi, which leads to this condition. Palpitations, in TCM, are also referred to as \"blood deficiency.\" Therefore, one is a deficiency of Qi, and the other is a deficiency of blood. Symptoms of palpitations indicate that the heart lacks sufficient strength, which leads to palpitations, known in TCM as blood deficiency. The \"floating pulse\" is because the exterior of the pulse represents Qi; when you feel it, you are sensing the Qi pulse, not the blood pulse. Yang represents Qi, while blood represents Yin. When blood is insufficient, Yang rises to the surface, resulting in a pulse that feels large and floating; in reality, the patient is experiencing blood deficiency.\n\nIn men, a weak, deep, and wiry pulse, without cold or heat, shortness of breath, difficulty urinating, a pale complexion, occasional eye closure, and abdominal fullness are symptoms resulting from overexertion. Here, several symptoms unique to overexertion are presented, and the practitioner categorizes them. If a man has a \"weak, deep, and wiry pulse,\" a weak pulse is one where you can feel a slight pulse, but when pressed harder, it disappears; this is called a weak pulse. Alternatively, the pulse may be very deep, only detectable near the bone, and again disappears with firm pressure. Or, the pulse may feel thin and string-like, which is also a weak pulse. In other words, the weak, deep, and wiry pulses all indicate a deficiency of both Qi and blood. The first situation is that the patient does not exhibit any signs of cold or heat. When you ask them, \"Do you feel cold? Do you feel hot?\" they respond, \"No.\" \"Shortness of breath and difficulty\" means that sometimes the patient experiences difficulty when moving slightly.",

The lungs, spleen, and stomach are involved, and the wheezing typically begins around 3 to 5 AM, consistently indicating a diagnosis of cold-induced wheezing. In addition to acupuncture, moxibustion can also be applied, using the same acupuncture points, as this is a treatment for deficiency syndrome. The points on the back include \"Fei Shu\" (Lung Shu), \"Pi Shu\" (Spleen Shu), and \"Wei Shu\" (Stomach Shu), among others. The treatment method employs the principle of \"earth generating metal.\" During cold-induced wheezing, moxibustion must be added, as its effects are rapid.

Excessive sweating causes the person to clasp their hands over their heart, experiencing palpitations beneath the heart that feel better when pressed.

When this upward force becomes too strong, the patient feels palpitations beneath the heart. The phrase \"clasping hands over the heart\" indicates discomfort that makes them want to press down, hence the sensation of palpitations beneath the heart, which feels more comfortable when pressed.\n\nSections 69 and 70 both pertain to conditions following sweating, but the intensity of sweating differs. Section 69 involves sweating from Ma Huang Tang, leading to a loss of chest yang, resulting in palpitations beneath the heart. Section 70 involves excessive sweating from Gui Zhi Tang, which depletes the fluids in the intestines and stomach, leading to insufficient water, causing palpitations around the navel and preparing for the sensation of Ben Tun. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, palpitations beneath the heart are...",

The 69th entry describes a situation after taking Ma Huang Tang, where the chest yang has diminished, leading to the sensation of heart palpitations below the heart. The 70th entry refers to excessive sweating from Gui Zhi Tang, resulting in a depletion of the stomach and intestinal fluids, causing insufficient water, which leads to a twitching sensation around the navel, indicating a preparation for the condition known as \"ben tun\" (running piglet syndrome).\n\nIn Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), heart palpitations below the heart do not refer to the heart itself being in a state of panic as seen clinically, but rather to the area around \"Zhong Wan\" (the middle abdomen) pulsating. This occurs because the heavenly yang above has dried up, causing the water to be forcibly drawn upwards, thus getting stuck at \"Zhong Wan.\" At this time, \"Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang\" (Cinnamon Twig and Licorice Decoction) is used.\n\nIt is important to have a conceptual understanding: the area around the navel is associated with the spleen, the area above the navel is associated with the kidneys, the area below the navel is associated with the heart, the left side of the navel is associated with the liver, and the right side is associated with the lungs. For example, if there is palpitations above the navel, treatment should focus on the kidneys, and similarly for other areas.\n\nGui Zhi Gan Cao Tang formula:\n- Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig) 4 liang (approximately 120 grams, peeled)\n- Gan Cao (Licorice) 2 liang (approximately 60 grams, roasted)\n\nCombine these two ingredients with 3 sheng (approximately 900 ml) of water, boil down to 1 sheng (approximately 300 ml), strain, and take it in one dose.\n\nIf using 4 qian (approximately 12 grams) of Gui Zhi, then use 2 qian (approximately 6 grams) of Gan Cao, as Gui Zhi is twice the amount of Gan Cao. This is because excessive sweating has occurred, and Gan Cao replenishes the stomach's fluids. \n\nWhy is only Gui Zhi used and not Bai Shao (White Peony)? Why does palpitations occur? When drinking water, the stomach is very hot, and when water enters the stomach, it vaporizes and becomes steam rather than remaining as water. If the water is stuck at \"Zhong Wan,\" Gui Zhi, being very warming, will cause the water to evaporate upwards. Additionally, the outer membrane of the heart contains many nerves and blood vessels in the diaphragm; within the blood vessels is \"blood,\" and in the nerves...",

          "english_text": "The text describes a condition characterized by \"yellowing of the face and wheezing, headache, nasal congestion, and restlessness, with a pulse that is large and capable of handling food intake, while the abdomen is harmonious and free of disease.\" The ability to handle food intake indicates that the middle and lower jiao (the digestive and lower regions of the body) are not diseased, while \"the illness resides in the cold and dampness of the head.\" \n\nIn such cases, we understand that the patient's dampness is located between the brain and the nose, specifically between the eyes and forehead. Dampness in this area can lead to nasal congestion. Due to the sticky nature of dampness, it can block the nose, causing the patient to wheeze and struggle to breathe, resorting to mouth breathing. When encountering this situation, we recognize that dampness exists within the nose, similar to what Western medicine refers to as sinusitis or nasal purulence, among other terms. \n\n\"The internal medicine will cure the nose.\" According to Zhong Shi, at this time, the medicine should be applied directly into the nose for the best effect. Since the patient's dampness is only accumulated in the nose, we only need to address the dampness there. If the medicine is taken orally, it will go to the stomach, which will delay treatment significantly compared to directly spraying the medicine into the nose. Therefore, when treating sinusitis, in addition to acupuncture, there is generally no need to use oral prescriptions; a nasal spray should be employed instead. \n\nIf we use acupuncture, we can select the Yingxiang point. If there is purulent discharge from the nose, with a lot of nasal mucus, we can use moxibustion on the Shangxing point, which is also a major point for nasal conditions. Baihui and Qianding points can also be used to treat nasal diseases. Points on the back such as Fengchi and Feishu can also treat nasal conditions, as the lungs open to the nose.\n\nWhen needling the Yingxiang point, if the nasal congestion does not clear immediately, it indicates that the needle has not reached the Yingxiang point. Therefore, if there is no sensation when the needle is inserted, do not doubt the acupuncture technique; rather, it may be that your technique needs improvement.",

The main reason is that Western medicine does not understand the source of dampness. Nasal sprays can dry out the sinus area due to the interaction between musk and alum. What about sweet flag (Acorus calamus)? In the past, when using sweet flag, it was first dried and then stored in a warehouse. Do you know when it was mostly used? It was used for edema. When patients experience such severe edema that their skin becomes transparent and taut, we take the dried sweet flag, burn it with fire, and it turns to ash like straw. We then mix the ash with some sesame oil and apply it to the skin. After application, we let the patient lie down, and soon they will begin to urinate, allowing the accumulated fluid to be expelled.\n\n(Nasal Congestion Formula):\nAsh from sweet flag, Asarum, soap pod, Ephedra.\nTake these four ingredients in equal parts, grind them into a powder, mix well, and place a small amount in the nose; sneezing will lead to recovery.\n\nFor those with dampness in the body, experiencing discomfort and pain, it is advisable to use Ephedra and Atractylodes Decoction to induce sweating, but be cautious not to use fire to attack it.\n\nEphedra and Atractylodes Decoction:\nThree taels of Ephedra (remove the nodes), two taels of Cinnamon Twig, one tael of Licorice, four taels of Atractylodes, and seventy pieces of Apricot Kernel (remove the skin and tip).\nCombine these five ingredients with nine sheng of water, first boil the Ephedra, reducing it by two sheng, skim off the foam, then add all the other herbs, and boil down to two and a half sheng, strain, and take warm in a dose of eight he, covering to induce slight sweating.\n\nWhen is Ephedra and Atractylodes Decoction used?

If there is no blood, the patient exhibits jaundice, a deep and tight pulse, hardness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, indicating a lack of blood. In this case, \"Yinchenhao Decoction\" will be used. Yinchenhao Decoction specifically targets heat in the bladder.

Bile is yellow; if there is excessive heat in the bladder, the secretion of bile becomes too heated, leading to jaundice in the patient. One should not underestimate blood stasis; it may not be visible on X-rays, but it can lead to manic behavior. This stasis can sometimes affect the brain. Depending on the situation, one might use \"Dachengqi Decoction\" or \"Dingdang Decoction.\" Therefore, it is essential to observe the urination patterns.

The front of the abdomen corresponds to the bladder, the middle is the Jing Gong (Essence Palace), and the back is the large intestine. Normally, the urine that is excreted is vaporized; during the vaporization process, some of the fluid moves into the gallbladder, where water generates wood and transforms into bile. The vaporization process is inherently hot, and when this heat enters the bladder, it transfers heat to the bladder, affecting the Tai Yang bladder meridian. The meridian connects to the bladder, and if the heat continues to enter, it can become excessively hot, causing blood vessels to rupture, leading to hematuria (blood in urine).

Therefore, what is expelled often contains a lot of residual moisture, which is why Western medicines or glycerin tablets cannot induce the intestines and stomach to produce body fluids.\n\n#SECTION\n\n119. \"Taiyang disease\" that does not resolve indicates a heat accumulation in the bladder, causing the person to appear manic, with blood flowing downward; those who have this condition will improve. If the exterior symptoms have not resolved, it is not yet appropriate to attack; one should first resolve the exterior. Once the exterior is resolved, if there is still urgent distension in the lower abdomen, then it is appropriate to attack, and \"Taohua Kernel Chengqi Decoction\" should be used.\n\n\"Taiyang disease not resolving\" means that there are still exterior symptoms of Taiyang disease, and the exterior heat has not dissipated. When Gui Zhi Decoction, Ge Gen Decoction, or Ma Huang Decoction are used to release the exterior, they may not have fully expelled the pathogen. This virus directly enters the interior from the meridians, penetrating the bladder from the surface of the skin. The front of the abdomen corresponds to the bladder, the middle to the Jinggong (the palace of essence), and the back to the large intestine. Normally, the water that is expelled in urination is vaporized; during the vaporization process, some of the water flows into the gallbladder, where water generates wood and transforms into bile. The vaporization process is inherently hot, and when this heat enters the bladder, it transfers heat to the bladder, affecting the Taiyang bladder meridian. The meridian connects to the bladder, and as the heat increases, if it becomes too intense, the blood vessels may rupture, leading to urination issues.",

          "english_text": "When experiencing hiccups, one feels even weaker. The occurrence of hiccups indicates that the stomach qi is exhausted, which is very dangerous. If the person is also exhibiting signs of \"hands and feet restlessness, fidgeting with clothes and touching the bed,\" it means that the stool is completely dry in the intestines. If urination is still smooth, it indicates that the original yang is still present, as urination is a manifestation of qi transformation, suggesting that body fluids are still available. However, if urination has ceased, it is indeed very dangerous.\n\nFor example, in the case of a child with a cold presenting with a Ma Huang Decoction pattern, if one dose causes excessive sweating and the fever subsides, it may shift to a Bai Hu Decoction pattern. If misdiagnosed and the child continues to have a fever, administering Da Qing Long Decoction may occur. The child continues to sweat, indicating a Tai Yang exterior pattern, which can quickly transform into a Yang Ming dryness pattern. The act of fidgeting and touching the bed signifies that body fluids are depleted. In the case of Yang Ming dryness-heat, it is difficult to accurately assess the pulse of a child, as their pulse is typically rapid even in normal conditions. If the abdomen is tender and the child resists palpation, it indicates that stool is obstructed inside. Should one consider Da Cheng Qi Decoction or Bai Hu Decoction for Yang Ming syndrome? Ultimately, due to the resistance to palpation, Da Cheng Qi Decoction is used. Once administered, the fever subsides. Additionally, this child has had jaundice since a young age, poor bowel movements, frequent Yang Ming dryness-heat, persistent thirst, and constipation, with slow cognitive responses. A single attack with Da Cheng Qi Decoction resolves these issues.\n\nXun Zhai states: \"This pattern should be treated according to the symptoms. For 'jaundice disease,' use Yin Chen Hao Decoction; for abdominal fullness with shortness of breath, delirium, and constipation, use Cheng Qi Decoction. The unique symptom of restlessness and fidgeting is a manifestation of near-exhaustion of the nervous system, and the principle is not to treat it.\" This phenomenon can be addressed with Da Cheng Qi Decoction. If the Bai Hu Decoction pattern causes strong fever, using Xi Jiao Di Huang Decoction may be beneficial, but if there is constipation, it will not improve.",

Therefore, the sweating method is employed to strengthen the immune system. In conditions of insufficient body fluids, one may experience \"both ears hearing nothing,\" as the ears rely on body fluids for moisture. \"Red eyes\" occur because the eyes are nourished by blood; when the water content in the blood is insufficient, the blood becomes heated, leading to inflammation, which first manifests as redness, swelling, and pain in the eyes. \n\n\"Fullness and agitation in the chest\" indicates that the individual has already been affected by pathogenic factors. In the past, when fullness in the chest was observed, it was generally treated with vomiting methods, as the illness was thought to be located in the upper jiao. However, if the physician mistakenly uses vomiting methods, it is inappropriate because the patient is not experiencing a blockage; rather, there is already a deficiency of body fluids. Inducing vomiting in such a case can harm the qi, as this refers to damaging the source of body fluids, leading to the expulsion of significant amounts of mucus and food.\n\nWhen purging is employed, it can damage the blood, as blood is generated from the small intestine. Food should be transformed into blood to nourish the body, but if it is eliminated before this transformation occurs, it can lead to blood deficiency. When the patient's vital energy is harmed, it can result in two types of internal deficiency: one is \"Xiao Jian Zhong Tang syndrome,\" and the other is \"Zhi Gan Cao Tang syndrome.\" If there are palpitations, it indicates damage to the upper jiao, corresponding to \"Zhi Gan Cao Tang syndrome.\" \n\n\"Vomiting and purging lead to palpitations and fright,\" as the heart and small intestine are interrelated. The heart is the sovereign organ, and when there is insufficient heart blood, the patient is more susceptible to fright. In such cases, \"Chai Hu Jia Long Gu Mu Li Tang\" is administered for fright. If there are palpitations, in addition to the phenomenon of palpitations, the pulse may also show a knotted or intermittent quality. Signs of fright can be observed as a bluish-purple discoloration in the area between the eyebrows and at the root of the nose.

The treatment should focus on warming the meridians, dispelling cold, and promoting blood circulation.\n\n**Recommended Formulas**:\n1. **Wen Jing Tang (Warm the Meridians Decoction)**:\n   - Wu Zhu Yu 3 liang\n   - Dang Gui 2 liang\n   - Chuan Xiong 2 liang\n   - Shao Yao 2 liang\n   - Ren Shen 2 liang\n   - Gui Zhi 2 liang\n   - E Jiao 2 liang\n   - Dan Pi 2 liang\n   - Sheng Jiang 2 liang\n   - Gan Cao 2 liang\n   - Ban Xia 0.5 sheng\n   - Mai Men Dong 1 sheng\n   \n   Boil the above herbs in water and take in two warm doses.\n\n2. **Tu Gua Gen San (Earth Gourd Root Powder)** (if cold congealing and blood stasis is present):\n   - Tu Gua Gen 3 fen\n   - Shao Yao 3 fen\n   - Gui Zhi 3 fen\n   - Chan Chong 3 fen\n   \n   Grind the above herbs into a powder, take with wine, a small spoonful three times a day.\n\nThese formulas can help regulate menstruation, alleviate menstrual pain, and promote blood circulation.",

In the evening, she experiences fever, urgency in the lower abdomen, abdominal fullness, hot palms, and dry lips. What is the cause? The teacher said: This condition is related to leukorrhea. Why? Because she has previously experienced a miscarriage, and the blood stasis remains in the lower abdomen. How do we know this? The symptom of dry lips indicates this. The appropriate treatment is the Warm Meridian Decoction.\n\nWarm Meridian Decoction Ingredients:\n3 taels of Wu Zhu Yu, 2 taels each of Dang Gui, Chuan Xiong, Bai Shao, Ren Shen, Gui Zhi, E Jiao, Dan Pi, Sheng Jiang, and Gan Cao; ½ sheng of Ban Xia; and 1 sheng of Mai Men Dong.\n\nCombine these twelve ingredients with one dou of water, boil to obtain three sheng, and divide into two warm doses.

It is important to study this aspect well to avoid future complications. If a girl reaches menopause and experiences \"diarrhea,\" this actually refers to blood loss. After the forty-nine days of the menstrual cycle, menstruation should cease. If, after the age of fifty, menstruation continues without stopping, it indicates blood loss that \"persists for several dozen days.\" \"In the evening, she experiences fever,\" meaning she has a fever that occurs in the evening. \"Urgency in the lower abdomen\" refers to cramping pain in the abdomen. \"Abdominal fullness\" indicates bloating. \"Hot palms\" refers to the palms being yin, while the back of the hands is yang; the heat in the palms arises from yin deficiency.

This condition is classified as a deficiency of both the liver and spleen. Sometimes, this can be caused by excessive alcohol consumption, heavy thinking, high work pressure, or feelings of loneliness at home, all of which can result in a state of deficiency in both the liver and spleen. Consequently, many young women may experience abnormal bleeding. Those who have studied the pulse of abnormal bleeding will recognize that the pulse is bounding on both sides in the area between the cun (寸) pulse and the guan (關) pulse, indicating that menstruation is flowing excessively.\n\nThe second condition is \"post-abortion bleeding that does not cease.\" Post-abortion refers to miscarriage. After a patient has a miscarriage, menstruation may not stop and continues indefinitely. The third condition is \"bleeding during pregnancy,\" where some individuals may experience bleeding during pregnancy or continue to bleed after giving birth. At this time, the patient's complexion appears dark, indicating significant blood loss. Zhang Zhongjing stated: \"All these phenomena can be treated with Jiao Ai Decoction.\" Jiao Ai Decoction is a very effective formula. In Jiao Ai Decoction, there is dried rehmannia (gan di huang), which itself nourishes the blood.

A woman who is supposed to have her menstrual period once a month may experience it four or five times instead. Sometimes it lasts for three days and then stops, only to return shortly after, creating a continuous cycle.\n\nWhen a man encounters this type of pulse, it indicates \"loss of blood and essence,\" because a man's essence and blood share the same origin, as do a man's sweat and blood. A man's essence is similar to a woman's breast milk in that it is white. A woman's breast milk is transformed from nutrients by the heat of the heart before descending to the uterus to become blood, while a man's essence is formed from nutrients by the heat of the small intestine, and both are white in color. The treatment for postpartum bleeding and miscarriage will be introduced later. How should a man with loss of blood and essence be treated? One option is to use Gui Zhi Long Gu Mu Li Tang (Cinnamon Twig, Dragon Bone, and Oyster Decoction), but this only prevents the loss of essence. If the goal is to enhance vitality, Gui Zhi Long Gu Mu Li Tang is not as effective; we need to rely on formulas like Tian Xiong San (Heavenly Hero Powder) and similar remedies.\n\nFor individuals who have lost blood, if they are induced to sweat, they may experience \"cold shivering and trembling.\" As I mentioned earlier, sweat and blood share the same origin in the human body, so individuals with conditions such as nosebleeds, blood loss, or sores should not be induced to sweat. Additionally, if a patient has numerous sores on their body, you should not induce sweating in that case either.\n\nIf a patient presents with fullness in the chest, dry lips, a bluish tongue, and a dry mouth but desires to rinse with water without wanting to swallow, with no signs of cold or heat, and a weak, delayed pulse, along with a complaint of fullness in the abdomen, this indicates the presence of stagnant blood. \n\nThe phrase \"patient with fullness in the chest and dry lips\" marks the beginning of our discussion on the diagnostic principles of blood stasis.

          "english_text": "Impediments to fetal growth. Simply put, if menstruation is normal during the first three months of pregnancy, but in the third month after conception there is continuous bleeding, and the blood is bright red, it indicates that the woman is pregnant but is likely to miscarry, and this is not due to any pathological condition causing the bleeding. If menstruation was already abnormal during the first three months, and then there is a continuous absence of menstruation for three months, at this point it is unclear whether she has a pathological condition or is pregnant. If, after the third month, she experiences continuous dark bleeding, it indicates that there is a pathological condition in the uterus, not a pregnancy. The practitioner wants to emphasize that it is essential to confirm that the woman is not pregnant before prescribing medication; misdiagnosis could lead to a pregnant woman taking Gui Zhi Fu Ling Wan, which could result in a miscarriage. \n\nAs for the continuous bleeding, why does her menstruation continue without stopping? It is because \"the pathology has not been resolved, hence the symptoms persist.\" Currently, in clinical practice, we find that Gui Zhi Fu Ling Wan is particularly effective for conditions such as uterine fibroids or ovarian tumors. I encountered a woman in clinical practice whose uterine fibroid was as large as a pomelo, and it felt very hard upon examination. Generally, women experience a depletion of their essence after the age of forty-nine, but this woman continued to have regular menstruation at the age of fifty-four. This lady was quite interesting; her perspective was unique. She had known about her uterine tumor for a long time, and despite the size of the tumor, when advised by Western medicine to undergo surgery, she refused. She asked the doctor, \"Will this be fatal?\" The doctor replied, \"There is a slight chance, but it is not certain; perhaps one in a thousand.\" She said, \"I will take my chances with that one in a thousand; I do not want surgery.\" This woman was also quite extraordinary.",

The prescription included three qian of Fuzi (Aconite), one piece of raw Aconite, and three qian of dried ginger, taken in three doses. This patient could not quench their thirst even when drinking water, due to a condition of vacuity heat. After taking such hot medicine, their thirst subsided.

Normally, the blood produced from the stomach's absorption of nutrients provides resistance, which is contained within the blood. Once the exterior pathogen invades, this resistance moves to the surface to combat the pathogen. At this time, menstruation occurs, causing the blood to descend, and the heat follows suit. This pathogenic heat then enters the uterus and liver. The term \"blood chamber\" has been debated; some say it refers to the uterus, while others say it refers to the liver. In fact, both are considered blood chambers, and Zhang Zhongjing did not differentiate between them. \"Fullness in the chest and hypochondrium\" is due to the lymphatic system being associated with the Sanjiao (Triple Burner), where the uterus is considered the lower burner and the chest and hypochondrium are considered the middle burner. \"Resembling stagnation of the chest,\" it appears as if there is chest stagnation. \"If there is delirium,\" it indicates that the patient's blood...",

          "english_text": "The uterus, when its blood is stagnant, can present symptoms resembling malaria, with periodic episodes. Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is indicated for this condition. As I mentioned last time, the onset of menstruation in women occurs because the milk flows down through the Chong and Ren meridians into the uterus, transforming into menstrual blood. When a woman catches a cold coinciding with her menstrual period, the virus can enter the uterus along with the milk. Since the genital area is primarily governed by the liver meridian, the illness can then progress from the uterus to the liver, which is situated above the diaphragm. Consequently, the patient may experience fullness and discomfort in the chest and sides, and the condition can deteriorate rapidly. At this point, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction may no longer be effective; instead, one should needle the Qimen point. Historically, many practitioners of classical formulas did not utilize acupuncture.\n\nThis section indicates that if the pathogenic factor of a Taiyang syndrome has already entered the uterus, Zhang Zhongjing states that it is too late to use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. \"This is heat entering the blood chamber.\" If it is too late, we can perform acupuncture at the Qimen point.

From this, it can be inferred that Zhang Zhongjing considers the uterus to belong to the Sanjiao system.\n\nIn cases of women suffering from cold damage with fever, coinciding with menstruation, if during the day they are clear-headed but at dusk they exhibit delirium, as if seeing ghosts, this indicates heat entering the blood chamber. For treatment, one must avoid disturbing the stomach qi and the upper two Jiao, and recovery will occur naturally. \n\n\"When a woman suffers from cold damage with fever, coinciding with menstruation, if during the day she is clear-headed but at dusk exhibits delirium,\" this means that during the day she feels well, but as the sun sets, she begins to show symptoms resembling \"seeing ghosts.\" \"This is heat entering the blood chamber; for treatment, avoid disturbing the stomach qi and the upper two Jiao, and recovery will occur naturally.\" For treating this condition, methods such as inducing vomiting, sweating, or purging are inappropriate; instead, a harmonizing approach is correct, such as using Xiao Chai Hu Decoction or allowing the patient to recover on their own.\n\nIn cases of women experiencing wind stroke, with fever and chills, coinciding with menstruation, if this condition persists for seven to eight days, and the heat subsides, the pulse becomes slow, and the body feels cool and harmonious, the chest...",

Western medicine currently only knows that this virus spreads very quickly, faster than the contagion of leprosy; once infected, it often leads to death. Western medicine still does not understand the true cause of this disease, but when they encounter it, their first action is to quickly isolate the patient. When rashes occur, they typically start from the abdominal area. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), if we see that the rash is red, the prognosis is grim, with a one in ten chance of survival. If the rash is black, the prognosis is even worse, with a one in ten chance of survival, indicating that black is the most dangerous. Western medicine recognizes the strong infectious nature of this disease, and there are no Western medications that can treat it. Therefore, in such situations, all items that the patient has come into contact with are quickly gathered and burned.\n\nIf this infectious disease occurs during wartime, when soldiers who have been in prolonged combat become infected, the contagion spreads rapidly. The onset of the disease starts from the abdominal area and quickly spreads to the limbs, and within one to two weeks, the person may die; at this point, it is referred to as \"war typhus.\" If it occurs in a prison, it is called \"prison typhus.\" On ships, it is termed \"ship typhus.\" Consider the commonalities among these locations. Firstly, the patients are all in a state of deficiency, as their diets are not normal. Secondly, they are confined to a limited space, lacking freedom of movement, which is why most of them contract this disease.\n\nIn TCM, there are two types of toxins: Yang toxin and Yin toxin.

          "english_text": "The resistance of pathogens leads to the emergence of Qi from within the body, and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) often uses the term \"Qi.\" The phrase \"wind Qi contending\" refers to the conflict between the Yang Qi within our body and the external wind pathogens (filtered viruses). When the wind is stronger than the Yang Qi, it can result in pruritic rashes, which are characterized by small, itchy red bumps on the skin. The saying \"the body is itchy, and itching leads to leakage\" implies that when there is itching, one naturally tends to scratch. Scratching causes the Qi of the skin to leak out, which can alleviate the itchiness.\n\nIf the itching persists due to wind, a patient can be given Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang (Ephedra and Atractylodes Decoction). This formula is essentially Ma Huang Tang (Ephedra Decoction) with the addition of Bai Zhu (Atractylodes), and its purpose is to induce a slight amount of surface sweating from the skin; it does not require excessive sweating to achieve a cure. The cause of pruritic rashes is that the body is supposed to sweat normally, but the external wind interferes, causing the sweat pores to become constricted, preventing the sweat from being expelled. At this point, the sweat has already left the sweat glands but has not exited the pores, so it remains trapped beneath the skin, leading to itching. This condition is not a true skin disease, so by using Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang to expel the trapped sweat, the pruritic rash can be resolved.\n\nMa Huang Jia Zhu Tang is well-designed for this purpose, as it can effectively release this layer of sweat without harming the normal body fluids. If the condition is due to liver disease causing ascites, one might say, \"Teacher, Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang can expel water.\" However, when this medicine is taken, the patient may not feel any effect because it addresses a different type of fluid accumulation. It is essential to confirm that the fluid is indeed trapped beneath the skin before using Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang. If one is unaware that Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang specifically treats this type of pruritic rash and does not administer it, the wind rash may persist untreated for too long, ultimately leading to more severe skin conditions such as scabs, leprosy, scabies, or other stubborn skin diseases.",

Generally, when encountering individuals with internal injuries, if they extend their tongue and the sides appear bluish, it indicates the presence of internal injuries. Additionally, patients may experience significant dryness in the mouth due to blood stasis obstructing the back, where blood has already left the blood vessels and accumulated in the muscle tissue or between the organs, leading to such symptoms. Patients may express a desire to rinse their mouth but do not wish to swallow; this reflects a psychological craving for water, yet when the water reaches their mouth, they do not want to ingest it. These symptoms are all indicative of external manifestations of blood stasis.\n\nIn our clinical practice, we have observed many women who, after undergoing surgery for breast cancer, experience extreme dryness in the mouth, finding it difficult to drink water, and when they do, they end up vomiting it back. This indicates the presence of blood stasis within the body, which hinders proper blood circulation. At this time, they may feel very thirsty, yet drinking water leads to vomiting.\n\nThe term \"no cold or heat\" refers to the observation that a patient's tongue may be dry, which could suggest Yangming heat. When we take the pulse, if there is no indication of cold or heat, and no exterior or interior symptoms, \"no cold or heat\" means there are no exterior symptoms present. The pulse of blood stasis is slightly larger and arrives late; this requires clinical experience to discern through palpation. \n\nWhen a patient states, \"My abdomen is not full, yet I feel very bloated,\" it indicates that while the abdomen does not appear distended, the patient continuously reports a sensation of fullness and discomfort inside.

Some individuals may have residual lochia that has not been completely expelled after childbirth, while others may experience it due to internal injuries or trauma. Various accidents can also lead to blood stasis within the body. There are several symptoms that can help us in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnose whether a patient has blood stasis. \n\nThe first symptom is \"chest fullness,\" where the patient feels a sensation of fullness in the chest. The second symptom is \"lip atrophy,\" where the lips become dry and shriveled. Why is this the case? I will explain shortly, but first, let’s note a few important symptoms. The second symptom is \"blue tongue and dry mouth,\" indicating dryness in the mouth and a bluish color of the tongue. \n\nIn TCM, the concept is that \"the heart governs blood.\" Therefore, when there is blood stasis, the blood's return to the heart is insufficient, leading to the sensation of chest fullness in the patient. For instance, when we use Gui Zhi Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction), if we encounter a patient with chest fullness, we need to remove Bai Shao (White Peony Root) because individuals with heart issues will experience chest fullness. \n\nAdditionally, the spleen governs transportation and transformation; it is associated with the earth element and is yellow in color. The spleen plays a crucial role in the transportation of nutrients within the body. During the process of blood production, if there is blood stasis obstructing the body, this stasis may be located in the stomach or intestines, but regardless, the presence of blood stasis indicates a problem with blood circulation. Consequently, this will hinder the normal transportation of blood to the limbs. \n\nThe spleen opens to the mouth, so at this time, we can observe that the patient’s mouth appears drier and more withered, lacking moisture. The tongue may show a bluish color, which is not the entire tongue but rather the sides of the tongue body. This observation is derived from clinical experience, and I have seen many cases.

If urination is smooth, the person may appear manic, which is indicative of a blood condition; \"Dingdang Decoction\" is the treatment for this.\n\nThis can be further divided into two categories: one with smooth urination and one with difficulty in urination, to differentiate between blood presence and absence. If there is no blood, the patient exhibits jaundice, a deep and tight pulse, hardness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, indicating a lack of blood. In such cases, \"Yinchenhao Decoction\" will be used. Yinchenhao Decoction specifically targets heat in the bladder. When there is heat burning below, after the bladder has been vaporized, some unhealthy urine is expelled while some good fluid enters the gallbladder, secreting bile to aid digestion. Bile is yellow; if there is excessive heat in the bladder, the secretion of bile becomes too heated, leading to jaundice in the patient. \n\nOne should not underestimate blood conditions; X-rays cannot detect blood issues, which can sometimes lead to the patient becoming manic. This stagnant qi can occasionally travel to the brain. Depending on the situation, sometimes \"Dachengqi Decoction\" is used, and sometimes \"Dingdang Decoction\" is appropriate. Therefore, it is essential to observe whether urination is smooth or obstructed. If urination is smooth, \"Dingdang Decoction\" is indicated. If the urine is very yellow, it suggests excessive heat in the lower jiao, and if there is no bowel movement, \"Dachengqi Decoction\" should be used to purge.\n\n140. In \"Shanghan\" (cold damage), if there is heat, fullness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, but the patient is now experiencing smooth urination, this indicates the presence of blood. It is necessary to purge immediately without leaving any medication behind, and \"Dingdang Pill\" is recommended.\n\nHeat blockage in the bladder should typically result in difficulty urinating; however, if urination is normal, and the patient reports pain in the lower abdomen around the \"Zhongji\" and \"Guanyuan\" areas, pain occurs when there is obstruction. If urination is good, it indicates that blood is blocked.",

The kidneys govern the bones; if a patient loses too much kidney essence, they will experience soreness in their bones. The term \"soreness that prevents movement\" refers to the patient feeling soreness in their bones rather than in their muscles. Therefore, some individuals who have suffered from labor-related conditions for many years without treatment may eventually develop nocturnal emissions. When this essence continuously leaks out, the patient cannot tolerate it and naturally feels very distressed, experiencing daily fatigue. We have Chinese herbal medicine that can help stabilize their Yang deficiency, as well as herbs that can replenish their Yin deficiency, among other treatments.\n\nIn men, a weak and floating pulse indicates infertility, with clear and cold essence. Here, the term \"floating and weak pulse\" represents the Qi pulse; when the pulse is floating, it indicates that the Qi is rising, meaning the patient's exterior is deficient. A weak pulse indicates insufficient blood, which also signifies that the patient's essence and blood are inadequate, indicating an internal deficiency. Patients exhibiting this phenomenon will certainly struggle with infertility because their essence is \"clear and cold.\" Men with labor-related conditions find it difficult to conceive. However, we have prescriptions in Chinese medicine that can treat this condition. You can refer to the formula below; after trying one or two doses, you will know whether it is effective.\n\nIf a 17 or 18-year-old child has a pale complexion, it indicates that they are in the early stages of development, and this physiological response may cause nocturnal emissions during sleep. If it occurs only occasionally, one or two times, it is quite normal and not a significant concern, as fullness leads to overflow. However, if it becomes severe, the individual may become deficient, and at this point, their complexion will appear pale, and they will exhibit a lack of energy. This aligns with the symptoms of Gui Zhi Long Gu Mu Li Tang (Cinnamon Twig, Dragon Bone, and Oyster Shell Decoction).",

          "english_text": "During sleep, the stomach's peristalsis gradually slows down. If a person eats a lot of food before going to bed, the stomach, which contains food, cannot remain inactive and thus becomes compressed. Normally, during sleep, the stomach fire decreases and peristalsis slows down. However, if food is consumed, it stimulates the stomach to continue moving, leading to a situation where the stomach is active while the person is asleep. Over time, this can result in elevated blood sugar levels. \n\nWestern medicine states that diabetes can be hereditary, but this is a partial truth; it should be prefaced with the phrase \"lifestyle habits.\" It is not a matter of hereditary constitution. Today, if the pancreas becomes fatty, it does not mean that a son will also inherit a fatty pancreas—such a notion is unfounded. In reality, it is due to shared lifestyle habits. For instance, a father who is busy working in a factory or company may not see his wife and children all day. When he returns home late, he calls out, \"Everyone get up and eat with Dad; I want to chat with you.\" Thus, the family ends up having late-night snacks together, discussing school matters, and then going to bed, repeating this daily. \n\nIf the father's lifestyle habits are unhealthy, he may develop diabetes, and consequently, the son may adopt the same late-night snacking habits, leading to the son also developing diabetes. This is what is meant by the inheritance of lifestyle habits. Men between the ages of thirty-five and forty-five are particularly prone to such issues, as this is often when their careers peak. Everyone is striving hard in their careers, and as a result, children also develop the habit of eating late-night snacks. Therefore, many people in their fifties find that while they have earned money, they discover they have diabetes when they want to enjoy life. In Chinese culture, the concept is...",

The stools that are expelled are mostly watery, resulting in feces being retained inside. Clinically, we observe that patients with colorectal cancer may initially present with either Cheng Qi Tang syndrome or Da Chai Hu Tang syndrome. They are either in the Yangming stage or in between Shaoyang and Yangming. In the Yangming stage, there are no signs of death, which indicates that the situation is not dangerous. However, patients who have undergone surgical treatment by Western medicine may develop liver or lung cancer post-operation, presenting symptoms that align with either Shaoyin syndrome or Jueyin syndrome. Therefore, we naturally oppose surgical interventions by Western medicine.\n\nFor patients with colorectal cancer who have not yet undergone surgery, if the blockage is near the end of the colon, specifically around the rectum, we should add Mang Xiao to break the blockage. When we encounter constipation with excess syndrome, where the patient resists abdominal palpation and cannot pass gas, we consider the use of Mang Xiao.\n\nThe formula for Da Chai Hu Tang is as follows:\n- Chai Hu: 250 grams\n- Huang Qin: 180 grams\n- Shao Yao: 180 grams\n- Ban Xia: 75 grams (washed)\n- Sheng Jiang: 250 grams (sliced)\n- Zhi Shi: 4 pieces (roasted)\n- Da Zao: 12 pieces (split)\n- Da Huang: 120 grams (approximately 75 grams for Ban Xia)\n\nCombine these eight ingredients with 12 liters of water, boil down to 6 liters, strain, then re-boil to obtain 3 liters. Administer 1 liter warm, three times a day.\n\nFor Da Huang, heavier individuals can use 6 grams, while lighter individuals can use 3 grams. The combination of Chai Hu, Huang Qin, Ban Xia, Sheng Jiang, and Da Zao constitutes the Xiao Chai Hu Tang formula. By omitting Ren Shen and Gan Cao, and adding Shao Yao, Zhi Shi, and Da Huang, we create the Da Chai Hu Tang. Zhi Shi is also a herb that can help to widen the intestines, similar to Hou Po. However, Zhi Shi is more effective for expanding the large intestine, while Hou Po is more effective for moistening the small intestine. The large intestine and lungs are interrelated, so when there is a blockage in the large intestine, Zhi Shi should be used.",

This diarrhea is due to the 'lower jiao' not being regulated, and it is treated with 'Chi Shi Zhi Yu Yu Liang Decoction' to address the excessive leakage. The lower jiao governs the separation of clear and turbid; in cases of diarrhea, the distinction between water and grain is lost. If astringent agents are taken and diarrhea does not cease, one should promote urination to facilitate the qi.\n\nClinically, moxibustion can also be applied to the points 'Da Chang Shu', 'Yao Shu', 'Zhong Ji', 'Guan Yuan', 'Shui Dao', and 'Shui Fen'.\n\nChi Shi Zhi Yu Yu Liang Decoction:\nOne pound of crushed Chi Shi Zhi, one pound of crushed Yu Yu Liang. \nCombine these two ingredients with six liters of water, boil down to two liters, strain, and divide into three warm doses.\n\nIn cases of 'Shang Han' (cold damage) lasting eight to nine days, after vomiting and diarrhea, if there is restlessness, hardness below the heart, pain below the ribs, qi rushing up to the throat, dizziness, and a return of sweating, the pulse is very weak, and if the meridians are reactive, it may develop into 'wei' (atrophy).\n\nAfter eight to nine days of 'Shang Han', if the patient has experienced vomiting and diarrhea, and after excessive vomiting, the food in the stomach and intestines is depleted. Therefore, excessive vomiting can lead to blood loss, as the source of nourishment is gone, resulting in the patient feeling restless. This restlessness arises because the heart governs blood; when blood is insufficient, the stomach becomes empty, and the fluids in the stomach are also inadequate. Consequently, the patient experiences 'hardness below the heart', feeling a hardness in the stomach. If pressure on the stomach reveals a hard lump, it indicates retained food; if it feels soft and pliable, it suggests that there is nothing inside, and the stomach wall has adhered together. 'Pain below the ribs, qi rushing up to the throat' occurs because the vomiting and diarrhea have caused damage; the stomach qi, which should descend, is instead rising.\"",

This condition occurs in many mothers, who often create numerous problems that did not originally exist in the world, such as, \"Which is more important, the daughter-in-law or the mother?\" However, this cannot be spoken aloud, as they know it is wrong, yet they still feel compelled to display many actions. When the son comes home, the two of them hold two pairs of slippers, waiting to see which one the son will choose to wear. Over time, this leads to worry, and worry can harm the lungs. Every day, they think about trivial matters. I often say that the problems in the world are inherently simple, but people complicate them. Therefore, many people suffer from neurasthenia and often fall ill, and even after recovering from illness, they still do not feel well. When you give them Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, they may take it but then vomit; no medicine seems to help. If the illness is deeper, the patient may experience headaches after urination, but gradually, after sixty days, they will start to improve. This indicates a deeper illness, as worry can harm the lungs, which govern the po (魄) and store the po. In our blood, there are two components: one is po, and the other is hun (魂). Worry can harm the lungs, making it impossible for the po to exist in the blood. Therefore, \"if there are spirits,\" it means the lung po is not secure. The hun cannot return to the liver; when the liver blood is damaged, a person becomes weak. In a state of deficiency of both lung qi and liver blood, this deficiency is not a true deficiency. If you give them tonifying qi and blood medicine, their body may not accept it, and they may vomit the medicine after taking it, making it impossible to help them. When the hun is not secure, the patient cannot sleep. Human sleep requires the hun to return to the liver for a person to fall asleep. For those with neurasthenia or hysteria, if the condition is more severe, after urinating, they may exclaim, \"Wow! My head hurts a lot!\"",

          "english_text": "Facial edema, shoulder breathing, and a pulse that is floating and large indicate a condition that, if untreated, will worsen significantly. This fundamentally represents a terminal condition. Why is it considered terminal? The swelling of the face signifies what we refer to as \"Yang deficiency.\" When Yang is deficient, the Yang energy rises upward. If there is no treatment when it reaches the lungs, the Yang energy will surge to the head and face, causing facial swelling. \"Shoulder breathing\" indicates that the patient's respiratory system is failing; the heart and lungs are on the verge of exhaustion, requiring the patient to move their shoulders to take a deep breath, as breathing has become difficult. If at this time the patient's pulse becomes very floating, large, and robust, it signifies that Yang has escaped. These phenomena occur when the body's kinetic energy and spirit are about to leave the body, indicating an incurable condition. \n\nIf there is \"increased diarrhea,\" with the patient experiencing incontinence of both urine and stool, it indicates that Yin has also become deficient. After Yang deficiency leads to Yin deficiency, this naturally results in a terminal condition. Therefore, when we see a patient with Yang energy rising, their face flushed, while experiencing diarrhea below, these are very dangerous symptoms, indicating that the internal organs are no longer receiving nourishment from food or medicine. Why is this considered a certain terminal condition? Because at this time, all kinetic energy is moving upward, and the patient has lost even the peristalsis of the gastrointestinal tract. At this point, anything the patient drinks will immediately be expelled; can you imagine how frightening that is? Isn't this akin to being on the brink of death? The heart, lungs, spleen, and stomach are all failing, and there is no longer any function.\n\nIf the patient exhibits \"wheezing and restlessness,\" this is termed \"lung distension,\" which may lead to water retention; sweating can alleviate this condition. \n\nIf the patient presents with \"wheezing and dryness,\" it is referred to as \"lung distension.\" In Traditional Chinese Medicine, what is clinically described as lung distension corresponds to what Western medicine calls emphysema. There are many causes of emphysema, such as living in...",

          "english_text": "A very effective diuretic, it can simultaneously strengthen kidney yang and eliminate lung cold. Therefore, the second point discusses water diseases that have already developed, where the illness penetrates inward. The reason for this inward progression is that the exterior water has not been treated, allowing it to gradually enter the interior.\n\nWhen the pulse is found to be deep, it indicates the presence of water, leading to body swelling and heaviness. If the pulse of a water disease patient is palpable, it signifies a critical condition. In all cases of edema, the pulse can only be felt at the edges of the bones. This is because when water is abundant, it compresses our blood vessels, causing the blood pulse to be very low, which is a normal manifestation of the disease. \"A palpable pulse indicates death\"; if the pulse is not deep but rather floating, it signifies a mismatch in pulse symptoms, indicating a critical condition where true yang is about to escape. If the water disease has persisted for too long without resolution, the entire skin and muscles may necrose, which is a very dangerous symptom. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), a mismatch in pulse symptoms is considered perilous. For instance, if you see a patient who is emaciated and lacks vital energy, yet their pulse is remarkably strong, it indicates that the patient is in a dangerous state. Conversely, if a thin and weak patient has a very fine pulse, this indicates a matching symptom, and such a condition is not life-threatening. Similarly, in cancer patients who are weak and unable to eat, if their pulse is rapid (nine to ten beats per breath), this indicates a critical condition. Some individuals may appear robust and strong, yet their pulse is thin and weak, which also indicates a mismatch in pulse symptoms, suggesting that this person is nearing death without realizing it.\n\nFor water disease patients, one characteristic is \"puffy bags under the eyes,\" which refers to the swelling of the eye bags beneath the eyes, exhibiting a somewhat translucent appearance, indicating that the person is suffering from thirst due to water retention. The abdomen is distended, urination is not smooth, and if the pulse is deep and absent, it indicates the presence of water, which can be purged. \n\nWater disease patients exhibit several characteristics; the first is \"puffy bags under the eyes,\" which indicates swelling beneath the eyes, suggesting the presence of water retention.",

          "english_text": "There are no cold or heat phenomena. When you ask the patient, \"Do you feel cold? Do you feel hot?\" they respond, \"No.\" \"Shortness of breath and urgency\" indicates that the patient sometimes has difficulty breathing after moving a little, and they often experience abdominal bloating and pain. \"Difficult urination\" means frequent urination with a small volume. \"Pale complexion\" refers to a sallow appearance. The patient often feels dizzy and may also experience \"epistaxis,\" which is frequent nosebleeds. Generally speaking, symptoms like difficult urination suggest that there is a problem with kidney function. A pale complexion indicates an issue with spleen function, as the complexion on our face is derived from the function of the spleen and stomach. Frequent nosebleeds suggest that there is a problem with the liver itself. \n\nWhy do we discuss these symptoms? The main reason is to inform you that when such conditions arise, it indicates that the person's liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys are all deficient. However, when you observe them, they may appear quite normal, yet all five organs are simultaneously deficient. This is known as \"labor syndrome,\" as \"this is caused by labor.\" These symptoms arise when there is a simultaneous deficiency in the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys.\n\nIn the case of labor syndrome as a disease, the pulse is floating and large, the hands and feet feel restless, symptoms are severe in spring and summer, and milder in autumn and winter. The deficiency of yin leads to spontaneous heat, and there is soreness and weakness that prevents movement. \n\nFor patients with labor syndrome, when they become ill, the pulse is \"floating and large,\" accompanied by \"restlessness in the hands and feet,\" where both the hands and feet exhibit signs of irritability. \"Severe in spring and summer, milder in autumn and winter\" indicates that this restlessness worsens during the warmer seasons, while it improves in the colder months. This is primarily because individuals with labor syndrome inherently have yin deficiency, which causes yang to rise. When the climate is warmer in spring and summer, the internal deficiency heat interacts with the external heat from the environment, leading to discomfort for the patient. In winter, the situation improves because of the cold outside.",
