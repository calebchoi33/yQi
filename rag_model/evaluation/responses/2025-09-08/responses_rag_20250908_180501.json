These symptoms can be differentiated as 'exterior wind-cold' or 'cold damage'.\\n\\n1. Symptom Analysis: \\n- Fatigue and shoulder/neck pain indicate an invasion of wind-cold, causing obstruction of qi and blood flow. \\n- Chills suggest deficiency of yang qi and invasion of external pathogens. \\n- Headache and fever of 39 degrees Celsius indicate internal heat pathogen, possibly due to wind-cold transforming into heat. \\n- Cough, sore throat, and white phlegm indicate lung involvement with phlegm obstructing the lungs. \\n\\n2. Syndrome Differentiation: \\nBased on the above symptoms, the patient belongs to the category of 'wind-cold cold' or 'cold damage' with exterior symptoms, and treatment should focus on dispersing the cold and clearing heat while transforming phlegm. \\n\\n3.

When observing blood in the blood vessels, it is red; however, when viewed through a layer of skin, the color of the blood appears yellow. This indicates that the water in the blood has been depleted. What is seen through the skin is the color of the blood, so this type of yellowing is not due to liver or gallbladder disease; do not confuse the two. This yellowing is caused by dehydration. In severe cases, when the body loses too much fluid, the brain does not receive adequate blood for nourishment, which can lead to convulsions. The liver governs the tendons, which also rely on blood for nourishment. Without sufficient blood supply, muscle cramps can occur, leading to spasms that tighten and then release repeatedly. \"Spasm\" refers to the relaxation of the tendons, while \"tightening\" refers to their contraction.\n\n\"If exposed to fire, one may still have a chance, but if exposed again, the situation worsens.\" If fire is used to roast the patient again, and the water in the blood is completely depleted, it will be fatal. Administering intravenous fluids can only provide temporary relief; the water will still be lost through urination. It is essential to consume water from food orally, as it must be absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract for the body to benefit.\n\n9.

          "english_text": "If the illness occurs at night, it is considered to arise from Yin; during the day, it is counted as daytime. Therefore, the day after the illness begins is regarded as the first day. It takes a full six days, and by the midnight of the sixth day, it will heal on its own, hence the saying \"heals in six days.\" Regardless of whether it is a Yin or Yang illness, if one catches a cold, it is expected to resolve in six days under normal circumstances. Thus, if one does not take medication for a cold, it will typically resolve within a week.\n\nThe terms \"Yin\" and \"Yang\" have broad interpretations. When distinguishing between cold and heat, cold is classified as \"Yin\" and heat as \"Yang.\" When differentiating between exterior and interior, the exterior is \"Yang\" and the interior is \"Yin.\" When categorizing organs, the solid organs are \"Yin\" and the hollow organs are \"Yang.\" When dividing by upper and lower, the upper is \"Yang\" and the lower is \"Yin.\" When distinguishing left and right, the left is \"Yang\" and the right is \"Yin.\" When differentiating between Qi and blood, Qi is \"Yang\" and blood is \"Yin.\" When distinguishing between deficiency and excess, deficiency is \"Yin\" and excess is \"Yang.\" Additionally, substances such as bodily secretions, moisture, and plasma are referred to as \"Yin,\" while intangible aspects such as the body's resistance, cellular metabolism, and the natural functions of various organs are referred to as \"Yang.\"\n\nRegarding \"Taiyang disease,\" if there is a headache that resolves on its own after seven days, it is due to the completion of its meridian. If one wishes to induce another cycle, one can needle the \"Foot Yangming\" point to prevent the meridian from transmitting, thus facilitating recovery.\n\nFor headaches, if they resolve on their own, they typically improve within a week. If a cold has not improved by the seventh day, it is advisable to see a doctor promptly. In the case of Taiyang disease, it may sometimes transmit to Yangming or Shaoyang, or transition from Yangming to Shaoyang, or from Shaoyang to Yangming; this is not fixed. If Taiyang disease has not yet reached the Foot Yangming stage, needling the primary point of Foot Yangming, \"Zusanli\" (ST36), will prevent the transmission.",

If there is a Taiyang disease, before it reaches the foot Yangming, if one first needles the primary point of foot Yangming, \"Zusanli,\" it will not transmit. Before it reaches foot Shaoyang, if one first needles the primary point of the Gallbladder channel, \"Linqi,\" it will not transmit. If by the sixth day and into the seventh day it has not improved, it may have transmitted to Yangming or Shaoyang. If a child has not improved by the seventh day and starts to show nausea and vomiting, it indicates transmission to Shaoyang. Yangming heat corresponds to the Large Intestine channel; because the body fluids are depleted, the stool will become obstructed in the Large Intestine. If a child becomes irritable, refuses to eat, throws things around, runs wildly at night, and fiddles with clothes and the bed, it indicates transmission to Yangming. The strong heat of Yangming is actually caused by the turbid qi of the stool rising to the brain.\n\n11. When \"Taiyang disease\" is to be resolved, it occurs from \"Si\" to \"Wei.\"\nBecause the disease is in Yang, after six days, by noon of the seventh day, it is actually six full days, which is from Si time to Wei time. At noon, it resolves. Therefore, when prescribing for a patient with Taiyang disease, if they take the medicine at nine o'clock in the evening, by ten o'clock, the symptoms will have disappeared, with only a slight dizziness remaining. By the next noon, their spirit will be completely restored, indicating that the illness is fully resolved. If the disease is in Yin, for example, in Shaoyin syndrome, if they start looking for something to eat in the middle of the night, it indicates recovery. If the disease is in Yang, by the next noon, if they have a strong appetite and eat vigorously, it indicates recovery.\n\n12. For \"wind stroke\" where the exterior has resolved but the patient remains unwell, recovery occurs in twelve days.\nIf one contracts a cold or wind stroke, takes medicine, and the exterior symptoms are resolved, but the patient still feels unwell, meaning they are lethargic and uncomfortable, and their spirit has not fully recovered, if they do not take medicine, they will recover in twelve days.

A slow pulse indicates cold; now, with \"Huangqin Decoction,\" the heat is again removed. The abdomen should feel cold, and the patient should be unable to eat, yet they can eat instead. This is termed \"removal from within,\" which indicates imminent death.\n\nIn cases of Cold Damage, the exterior symptoms are present: aversion to cold, fear of cold, and generalized soreness in the bones and joints. However, upon palpating the patient's pulse, it is slow, and the pulse signs do not match. Yet, the patient is treated with Huangqin Decoction to clear the heat. The slow pulse indicates cold; now, with Huangqin Decoction, the heat is again removed. Huangqin Decoction is a remedy that clears heat and induces diarrhea. As a result, \"the abdomen should feel cold, and the patient should be unable to eat, yet they can eat instead.\" This indicates that what is observed is true cold masquerading as heat. The assumption that fever and aversion to cold indicate heat leads to the administration of cold and cooling medicines, which, when applied, exacerbate the internal cold, resulting in \"removal from within,\" meaning that the stomach qi is completely depleted. At this point, a large dose of Si Ni Decoction should be used to rescue the counterflow; one must not ignore the signs of impending death without intervention.\n\n**348. \"Cold Damage\"**: If there is initial coldness followed by fever, diarrhea will surely stop on its own.

Since the immune system resides within the body fluids, when the fluids are compromised, if the patient is sweating, it indicates that the exterior is unable to consolidate.

If it does not descend to the throat, the diarrhea will result in pus and blood; \"if there is pus and blood, the throat will not be obstructed.\" Therefore, if there is pus and blood, the throat will not hurt. The inflammatory filterable virus cannot be eliminated by herbal medicine or the immune system; it must have an outlet.

When experiencing a cold and fever, sweating can be used to resolve it; however, in the case of Jueyin syndrome, sweating should not be used.

          "english_text": "Here is the translation of the provided Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) text:\n\n---\n\nThe condition has arrived. When experiencing a cold with fever, sweating is used to resolve it. However, if it is a case of Jueyin syndrome, sweating should not be used. In Jueyin syndrome, filtered viruses reside in the liver, and sweating from the skin is unrelated to the liver; instead, it further damages the fluids of the gastrointestinal tract and harms the immune system.\n\nSection 351: \"In cases of cold damage,\" if there is Jue (a state of cold) for five days and heat for five days, if on the sixth day the Jue does not return, the patient will recover on their own. Jue does not last more than five days, and heat lasts for five days, hence it is known that self-recovery occurs.\n\nIf a person is in a coma for five days and has heat for five days, by the sixth day they should feel cold; if the patient does not feel cold, it indicates that the illness is improving, which signifies the restoration of stomach qi, and thus they will not feel cold.\n\nSection 352: Any state of Jue occurs when the yin and yang qi do not connect smoothly, resulting in Jue. Jue is characterized by coldness in the hands and feet.\n\nJue refers to the hands and feet being cold up to the elbows and knees. When the yin and yang qi do not connect smoothly, it indicates an obstruction in blood circulation. When blood circulation is unobstructed, the person feels warm; when it is obstructed, and the heart weakens, the person may fall into a coma.\n\nSection 353: \"In cases of cold damage,\" the pulse is weak and there is Jue. After seven to eight days, the skin feels cold, and the person is restless, unable to find peace; this is known as concealed Jue. It is different from the Jue caused by parasites.\n\nSection 354: In cases of parasitic Jue, the person often vomits parasites. In the current patient, they are quiet but become agitated at times; this indicates parasitic Jue. The parasites ascend and enter the diaphragm, causing agitation, which may cease momentarily. If the person eats and then vomits and feels agitated, it is because the parasites sense the smell of food and will emerge, leading the person to vomit parasites. For parasitic Jue, \"Wumei Pill\" is the primary treatment, and it also addresses prolonged diarrhea.\n\nThe patient exhibits signs of agitation, with a weak pulse, showing characteristics of Shaoyin and Jueyin. In Shaoyin syndrome, agitation and inability to lie down persist continuously, while in Jueyin syndrome, agitation may fluctuate between being agitated and calm; this is a case of organ Jue, which is different from parasitic Jue. \"In cases of parasitic Jue, the person often vomits parasites,\" indicating that the parasites are expelled from the mouth.\n\n--- \n\nThis translation maintains the technical terminology and concepts of Traditional Chinese Medicine while accurately conveying the original meaning.",

          "english_text": "The restlessness can sometimes be intense and sometimes mild; this is known as \"Zang Jue\" (organ obstruction), which is different from \"Xian Jue\" (parasite obstruction). \"Xian Jue\" refers to a condition where the person often vomits parasites, which are expelled from the mouth. In the current case, the patient is calm at times but also experiences episodes of restlessness. \"This is indicative of Xian Jue,\" suggesting that there are parasites in the abdomen, leading to such symptoms. \"When the parasites ascend and enter the diaphragm, it causes restlessness.\" The upward movement of the parasites results in this phenomenon of agitation. \n\n\"When food is ingested, it leads to vomiting,\" as the parasites are attracted to the smell of food and the person is likely to vomit the parasites as well. For Xian Jue, \"Wu Mei Wan\" (Black Plum Pill) is the primary treatment, and it also addresses prolonged diarrhea. In fact, patients who develop Xian Jue often have a stomach that is too cold; when the stomach is excessively cold, it is prone to parasite growth. This condition is included in the category of Jue Yin syndromes because the coldness in the stomach is related to the liver. The liver is responsible for detoxification in the body, and it eliminates toxins. However, if the liver is cold, its detoxification function is not very strong. When entering the Jue Yin syndrome, many viruses may accumulate in the liver, and with the liver's detoxification function not operating normally, it becomes easy for parasites to thrive in the stomach.\n\nThe temperature of the parasites aligns with the human body temperature. When a person eats, the parasites also consume food. If the stomach is cold and not receiving food, the parasites inside experience hunger and cold, leading them to move upwards. When they ascend, the patient's emotions become very agitated. White spots can be observed on the patient's lips, and they may also experience abdominal pain. Generally speaking, abdominal pain indicates internal cold. In cases of internal cold, \"Xiao Jian Zhong Tang\" (Minor Construct the Middle Decoction) should be used with a heavy emphasis on \"Shao Yao\" (Peony Root), which is used at double the amount of \"Gui Zhi\" (Cinnamon Twig). In cases of internal cold, the pulse should be deep and tight.",

If too much sweat is produced, naturally, the body fluids will be inadequate, leading to decreased urination. \n\nIf purging occurs, there may be a direct gaze and loss of urination. The essence of Zhang Zhongjing's \"Shang Han Lun\" is that when a patient has an exterior syndrome, one must first resolve the exterior before attacking the interior. If the exterior is excessively resolved, the body fluids will be harmed; if the interior is attacked too quickly, the body fluids will also be harmed. If one attacks the interior without first resolving the exterior, it may result in the complete expulsion of all contents from the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine, leading to a sudden loss of nutrition. The food in the body is continuously being digested and providing energy. If everything is expelled suddenly, the source of energy is lost, resulting in a lack of physical strength. The patient may have a fixed gaze, and urination may leak out. The term \"loss of urination\" here refers not to normal urination but to leakage. \n\nThe liver stores blood and the soul, and it governs the eyes. We have one-fifth of our blood in the liver, and this blood is not static but continuously circulates. If the source is suddenly lost, the liver blood will become depleted.

This indicates that the water in the blood has been depleted. What is seen through the skin is the color of the blood, so this type of yellowing is not due to liver or gallbladder disease; do not confuse it. This yellowing is caused by dehydration.

When distinguishing between cold and heat, cold is classified as \"Yin\" and heat as \"Yang.\" When differentiating between exterior and interior, the exterior is \"Yang\" and the interior is \"Yin.\" When categorizing organs, the solid organs are \"Yin\" and the hollow organs are \"Yang.\" When dividing by upper and lower, the upper is \"Yang\" and the lower is \"Yin.\" When distinguishing left and right, the left is \"Yang\" and the right is \"Yin.\" When separating Qi and blood, Qi is \"Yang\" and blood is \"Yin.\" When differentiating between deficiency and excess, deficiency is \"Yin\" and excess is \"Yang.\" Additionally, substances such as bodily secretions, moisture, and plasma are referred to as \"Yin,\" while intangible aspects such as the body's resistance, cellular metabolism, and the natural functions of various organs are referred to as \"Yang.\"\n\nRegarding \"Taiyang disease,\" if there is a headache that resolves on its own after seven days, it is due to the completion of its meridian.

If a cold has not improved by the seventh day, it is advisable to see a doctor promptly. In the case of Taiyang disease, it may sometimes transmit to Yangming or Shaoyang, or transition from Yangming to Shaoyang, or from Shaoyang to Yangming; this is not fixed. If Taiyang disease has not yet reached the Foot Yangming stage, needling the primary point of Foot Yangming, \"Zusanli\" (ST36), will prevent the transmission.",

In cases of cold dampness, the formulas \"Zhu Fu Decoction\" and \"Wu Ling San\" can be used to dispel cold dampness.\n\n274. In \"Shang Han\" (Febrile Disease), if after seven to eight days the body appears yellow like an orange, with difficulty urinating and slight abdominal fullness, \"Yin Chen Hao Decoction\" is indicated. The yellowish appearance like that of an orange indicates Yang jaundice, which signifies heat. Difficulty in urination and slight abdominal fullness suggest that dampness is unable to be discharged and is constricted in the lower abdomen, leading to a blockage that prevents urination. When heat and dampness congeal in the lower jiao, \"Yin Chen Hao Decoction\" is used.\n\n275. In \"Shang Han,\" if there is stagnant heat inside, the body will inevitably turn yellow; \"Zhi Zi Bai Pi Decoction\" is indicated. Huang Bai (Phellodendron) is a herb that can clear heat from the lower jiao. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, heat corresponds to inflammation in Western medicine; for instance, Huang Bai is often used for urethritis. Zhi Zi (Gardenia) can clear heat from the upper jiao, while Huang Qin, Huang Lian, and Gan Cao can clear heat from the middle jiao. Therefore, Zhi Zi Bai Pi Decoction is another remedy for jaundice, distinct from Yin Chen Hao Decoction. The latter addresses dampness that is obstructing the intestines, which is why it contains Da Huang (Rhubarb). The heat in Zhi Zi Bai Pi Decoction is stagnant in the San Jiao (Three Jiao), which includes the upper, middle, and lower jiao, indicating that the lymphatic system is inflamed. Patients taking Zhi Zi Bai Pi Decoction may experience difficulty urinating and abdominal distension, while those taking Yin Chen Hao Decoction have stagnant heat in the intestines, leading to difficulty urinating. Thus, these are two formulas for Yang jaundice: if the patient is entirely yellow, with a distended abdomen and difficulty in both urination and defecation, Yin Chen Hao Decoction is appropriate; if urination and defecation are normal and there is no abdominal distension, Zhi Zi Bai Pi Decoction is suitable. Both formulas are relatively cool and are used in cases of febrile diseases.\n\nZhi Zi Bai Pi Decoction is also commonly used as an eye wash for red, painful, and inflamed eyes. After preparing the decoction, it is filtered through a sieve for use in washing the eyes. \n\n《類聚方》",

The damp-heat present in alcohol is quite significant, and Atractylodes is used to address this; however, dampness needs a pathway for elimination. Alisma itself can promote urination, relying on its diuretic properties to expel dampness, which is then discharged through urination. Therefore, for those who have consumed too much alcohol before today and experience gastric prolapse, using Wu Zhu Yu Decoction can help restore the stomach. Each time after drinking, it is advisable to use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with an increased dosage of Ban Xia, as Ban Xia can alleviate nausea, preventing the urge to vomit.

If the Guan pulse has moved to the Cun position, it signifies that Yang heat is rising to the upper jiao due to excessive heat in the gallbladder and stomach, leading to the upward rebellion of bile, which causes a bitter taste in the mouth. This indicates that heat from the stomach and gallbladder is rising, representing the need for Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. Therefore, by palpating the pulse, one can understand the progression of the body's condition. \"But desires to sleep,\" indicates that the patient's vitality has already been significantly depleted during the Tai Yang phase, and upon entering the Shao Yang phase, the gastrointestinal absorption is poor, preventing food from being transformed into blood, as it is affected by the San Jiao.",

Sometimes, it is not necessary to give the patient medication, as the illness may not necessarily transmit. Each person's constitution is different; generally speaking, those who do not take Western medicine for many years and have a strong immune system will not have the illness enter the Yin stage, because Western medicine can significantly weaken the immune system.\n\nSection 285: \"In cases of cold damage\" for three days, if the pulse in the Shaoyang is weak, it indicates that the illness is about to resolve. Regardless of whether it is Shaoyang or Yangming, when the pulse begins to slow down, it indicates that the illness is on the path to recovery. If the patient's pulse is very normal, and there is nausea with a pulse of four beats per breath, this is a sign of pregnancy, not an illness. For a normal person, if the pulse is normal but there are discomfort symptoms, it indicates conception has occurred, and one should not casually prescribe medication.\n\nSection 286: When a Shaoyang illness is about to resolve, it occurs from the Yin hour to the Chen hour. This is because the Eastern direction corresponds to the Wood element (Jia and Yi, Yin and Mao), and since Shaoyang is associated with Wood, the resolution of a Shaoyang illness occurs during this time frame.\n\nThe above discusses the Shaoyang syndrome.\n\nDifferentiating the Taiyin illness, pulse signs, and treatment methods:\nTaiyin is referred to as \"beginning Yin,\" while Shaoyin is \"within Yin,\" and Jueyin is \"the end of Yin,\" representing the extremity of Yin. When one first enters the Shaoyin stage, it becomes dangerous if it progresses to Jueyin without treatment. Traditional Chinese Medicine aims to prevent the three Yin organs from being affected by pathogens; the initial stage is always Taiyin. Therefore, when Zhang Zhongjing prescribed formulas, he always considered the issues related to Taiyin, regardless of whether the illness had progressed to Shaoyin or Jueyin, because the initial onset of illness occurs in the Taiyin stage.\n\nTaiyin corresponds to the spleen. Generally speaking, those whose illness enters the spleen are individuals with a weak stomach. In TCM, the spleen and stomach are interrelated; the spleen and stomach are the foundation of postnatal health. Those who are healthy in the postnatal stage will have a strong spleen and stomach.",

This condition is characterized by systemic cold and dampness; to eliminate dampness, Bai Zhu (Atractylodes) can be used at a dosage of five qian (a traditional Chinese measurement), which is suitable for individuals with a larger body type. The dampness must have an outlet, which is facilitated by Fu Ling (Poria), allowing it to be expelled through urination. To dispel cold, Pao Fu (processed Aconite) is used at a dosage of three qian, along with some fresh ginger to harmonize the stomach. Most importantly, \"Sheng Fu\" (raw Aconite) is included, with one piece used. Pao Fu strengthens the interior Yang, thereby eliminating the interior cold. The cold affecting the muscles and the Sanjiao network is entirely removed by Sheng Fu. After taking this formula, the patient will experience an increase in urination, and their stools may become loose or watery. After three doses, the tongue coating will return to normal, and the appetite will significantly improve. Clinically, for patients with uremia, after taking one dose, the uremia index can drop from 180 to 130. Pao Fu warms the middle, while Sheng Fu warms the channels, benefiting the blood vessels and nerves. This is the main formula, and in clinical practice, adjustments can be made based on the patient's additional symptoms. If the appetite is poor and there is frequent nausea, Ban Xia (Pinellia) can be added, and so forth. Some patients with chronic illnesses may experience the expulsion of \"white fluids\" or loose stools after taking the medicine to eliminate cold and dampness, and this condition will improve when the patient begins to feel thirsty.\n\n#FORMULA\n\nZang Jie Decoction:\nChai Hu 5 qian, Bai Zhu 5 qian, Fu Ling 5 qian, Pao Fu 3 qian, Sheng Fu 1 piece.\n\nThis is the main formula; other adjustments should be made based on clinical observations. \n\n#SECTION",

In cases of \"Shang Han\" (cold damage), if there is vomiting or diarrhea, and after seven to eight days there is no resolution, with heat accumulation inside, both exterior and interior are hot, with occasional sweating, aversion to wind, great thirst, and agitation, the tongue is dry, desiring to drink several sheng (a unit of volume), \"Bai Hu Jia Ren Shen Tang\" (White Tiger Decoction with Ginseng) is indicated.\n\nIn cases of Shang Han, the exterior and sweating methods should be used. However, after vomiting and diarrhea, the stomach's fluids will definitely be harmed, and if there is no improvement after seven to eight days, it results in \"heat accumulation inside, both exterior and interior are hot.\" There is illness inside and illness outside; where does the internal heat come from? It arises because the fluids are damaged, and the body's heat is trapped within the fluids and also within the blood. A portion of the heat, after the fluids are harmed, leaves the fluids and the blood and rises to the surface, causing internal heat. The first organ to be affected is the lung, which governs the skin and hair. At this time, the patient often feels sweaty, fears the wind, experiences great thirst and agitation. When the upper jiao (the upper burner) is too dry and hot, it is because the fluids are depleted; the upper jiao is like the sky without clouds, with the sun shining directly, making it very hot. This is the pattern of Bai Hu Tang (White Tiger Decoction), as the yang of the chest is elevated, and the heart and lungs have a certain level of humidity. The chest is already very hot, and the heat from the stomach rises, with all the fluids lost and sweated out, resulting in a \"dry tongue.\" When the tongue is extended, there is no saliva at all, and it can be severe enough that the tongue coating turns upwards. \"Desiring to drink several sheng of water\" indicates thirst; even after drinking for a long time, one cannot quench the thirst because the water goes down into the stomach but does not get absorbed. The water that is truly absorbed relies on the gastric fluids to resolve it, but as a result, the gastric fluids have been completely vomited out and are no longer present.",

          "english_text": "When water enters the stomach, it moves downward and cannot be absorbed because the actual absorption of water relies on gastric juices to break it down. As a result, if the gastric juices are completely expelled, there is nothing left to convert the water into vapor, causing the water to flow directly downward and failing to quench thirst. This is indicative of the \"Bai Hu Jia Ren Shen Tang\" syndrome.\n\n\"Bai Hu Jia Ren Shen Tang\" is a formula in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for treating diabetes with upper digestive issues, and it is also one of the best remedies for \"heart heat.\" It does not matter if there are exterior symptoms; if there is internal heat, particularly when heat is present in the chest, \"Bai Hu Jia Ren Shen Tang\" should be used. The Bai Hu Tang syndrome is characterized by dryness, thirst, and irritability. Therefore, when prescribing Bai Hu Tang to a patient, their external condition may be misdiagnosed as a mental illness due to frequent outbursts of anger. However, TCM recognizes that they are experiencing dryness and thirst, with body fluids depleted, leading to an inability to control emotions. \n\nWhy add Ren Shen (ginseng)? Normally, people do not need to take ginseng unless there is a deficiency of body fluids. Ginseng is often used in gastroenterology, which is why it is included in the Xie Xin Tang formula. When ginseng is administered, it quickly replenishes the body fluids. After replenishing, Bai Hu Tang can then effectively reduce the heat, with gypsum being the most effective for cooling down the heat. \n\nCurrently, there is a situation in diabetes where blood sugar can easily drop too low, leading to rapid hunger, and patients often need to consume sugar. Bai Hu Tang is also applicable in these cases.\n\nNow, regarding monosodium glutamate (MSG) in food, consuming it leads to persistent thirst and an unquenchable need for water, which is also a manifestation of Bai Hu Tang syndrome. When MSG is ingested, it directly transforms into the Bai Hu Tang syndrome without passing through any exterior symptoms. This indicates its harmful effects on the human body, which is why we advise against adding MSG to food.",

A slow pulse indicates cold; now, with the administration of \"Huangqin Decoction,\" which again clears the heat, the abdomen should feel cold, and the patient should be unable to eat. However, the patient can eat, which indicates \"clearing the interior,\" and this is a sign of impending death.\n\nIn cases of Cold Damage, the exterior symptoms are present: aversion to cold, fear of cold, and generalized aches in the bones and joints. However, upon palpating the patient’s pulse, it is found to be slow, and the pulse pattern does not match the symptoms. Instead, the patient is treated with Huangqin Decoction to clear the heat. The slow pulse indicates cold; thus, administering Huangqin Decoction, which is a cooling and purging medicine, results in the abdomen feeling cold, leading to an inability to eat. The fact that the patient can eat indicates \"clearing the interior,\" suggesting that what is observed is true cold masquerading as heat. The assumption that the fever and aversion to cold indicate heat leads to the prescription of cold and cooling medicines, which, when administered, exacerbate the internal cold, resulting in \"clearing the interior,\" meaning that the stomach qi is completely depleted.

Since the immune system resides within the body fluids, when the body fluids are compromised, if the patient begins to sweat, it indicates that the exterior is unable to consolidate, leading to a very dangerous situation.

          "english_text": "Here is the translation of the provided Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) text:\n\n---\n\nThe condition has arrived. When experiencing a cold with fever, sweating is used to resolve it. However, if it is a case of Jueyin syndrome, sweating should not be used. In Jueyin syndrome, the filtering virus resides in the liver, and sweating from the skin is unrelated to the liver; instead, it further damages the fluids of the gastrointestinal tract and harms the immune system.\n\nSection 351: \"In cases of cold damage,\" if there is Jue (a state of collapse) for five days and heat for five days, if on the sixth day it returns to Jue, then if it does not return to Jue, it will self-resolve. Jue does not last more than five days, and heat lasts for five days, hence it is known that self-resolution occurs.\n\nIf there is coma for five days and heat for five days, by the sixth day, the patient should feel cold; however, if the patient does not feel cold, it indicates that the illness is improving, which signifies the restoration of stomach qi, and thus the patient will not feel cold.\n\nSection 352: Any state of Jue occurs when the yin and yang qi do not connect smoothly, resulting in Jue. Jue is characterized by coldness in the hands and feet.\n\nJue refers to the hands and feet being cold up to the elbows and knees. When the yin and yang qi do not connect smoothly, it indicates an obstruction in blood circulation. When blood circulation is smooth, the person feels warm; when it is obstructed, and the heart is weakened, the person may fall into a coma.\n\nSection 353: \"In cases of cold damage,\" the pulse is weak and there is Jue. After seven to eight days, the skin feels cold, and the person is restless, unable to find peace; this is known as concealed Jue, which is different from the Jue caused by parasites.\n\nSection 354: In cases of parasitic Jue, the person often vomits parasites. In the current patient, there is stillness, but at times there is restlessness; this indicates parasitic Jue. The parasites ascend and enter the diaphragm, causing restlessness, which may cease momentarily. If the patient eats and then vomits and feels restless, it is because the parasites sense the smell of food and will likely cause the person to vomit parasites. For parasitic Jue, \"Wu Mei Wan\" is the primary treatment, and it also addresses prolonged diarrhea.\n\nIn patients exhibiting restlessness, the pulse is weak, with signs of Shaoyin and Jueyin. In Shaoyin syndrome, restlessness and inability to lie down persist, while in Jueyin syndrome, restlessness may fluctuate between agitation and calmness; this is a case of organ Jue, which is different from parasitic Jue. \"In cases of parasitic Jue, the person often vomits parasites,\" indicating that the parasites are expelled from the mouth.\n\n--- \n\nThis translation maintains the original meaning and technical precision of the TCM concepts presented in the text.",

          "english_text": "The restlessness, sometimes agitated and sometimes calm, is a manifestation of \"Zang Jue\" (organ obstruction), which is different from \"Xian Jue\" (worm obstruction). \"Xian Jue\" refers to a condition where the person often vomits worms, which are expelled from the mouth. \"In the current patient, there are moments of calmness and moments of agitation.\" \"This is indicative of Xian Jue,\" suggesting that there are worms in the abdomen, leading to this phenomenon. \"When the worms ascend and enter the diaphragm, it causes agitation.\" The upward movement of the worms results in feelings of restlessness. \"When food is ingested, it leads to vomiting,\" because \"the worms sense the smell of food and will cause the person to vomit worms.\" For Xian Jue, \"Wu Mei Wan\" (Black Plum Pill) is the primary treatment, and it is also effective for prolonged diarrhea. In fact, patients who develop Xian Jue often have a stomach that is too cold; when the stomach is excessively cold, it is prone to the growth of worms. This condition is included in the category of Jue Yin syndromes because the coldness in the stomach is related to the liver. The liver is the organ responsible for detoxification; it eliminates toxins from the body. However, if the liver is cold, its detoxification function is not very strong. When entering the Jue Yin syndrome, many viruses may accumulate in the liver, and with the liver's detoxification function not operating normally, it becomes easy for worms to thrive in the stomach. The temperature of the worms aligns with the human body temperature; when a person eats, the worms also consume food. When the stomach is cold and not receiving food, the worms inside experience hunger and cold, leading them to move upwards. When they ascend, the patient's emotions become very agitated. One can observe white spots on the patient's lips, and the patient may also experience abdominal pain. Generally speaking, abdominal pain indicates internal cold. In cases of internal cold, \"Xiao Jian Zhong Tang\" (Minor Construct the Middle Decoction) should be used with a heavy emphasis on \"Shao Yao\" (Peony Root), which is used at double the amount of \"Gui Zhi\" (Cinnamon Twig). In cases of internal cold, the pulse should be deep and tight.",

Belching occurs when the stomach qi is about to be exhausted, as the stomach is located right at the diaphragm. Normally, the peristalsis of the stomach coincides with the movement of the diaphragm, which the person does not feel. During breathing, the diaphragm moves up and down; when inhaling, the diaphragm descends and presses against the stomach. If the diaphragm rebounds immediately upon inhalation, it will remain in the diaphragm area, meaning that the cold herbs have slowed down the peristalsis of the stomach.\n\nWhen the stomach is completely deficient, the most severe treatment is \"Fu Ling Si Ni Tang\" (Poria Four Reversal Decoction), while a lighter approach would be \"Li Zhong Tang\" (Regulate the Middle Decoction), and an even lighter option is \"Wu Zhu Yu Tang\" (Evodia Decoction). \"Wu Zhu Yu Tang\" is used to treat \"stomach prolapse.\" Using \"Li Zhong Tang\" is already quite risky, while \"Fu Ling Si Ni Tang\" is used when the patient is on the verge of collapse, indicating that the stomach can no longer process the five grains.\n\nThis section emphasizes that one must not assume that \"not eating\" is due to a blockage in the Yangming channel. If one cannot discern between cold and heat, administering cold herbs may cause the patient to belch. Conversely, if consuming cold herbs leads to belching, it indicates that the stomach is inherently cold.",

This indicates the onset of \"jaundice,\" and even if purged, the abdomen remains distended; this is primarily due to the slow pulse.\n\nYangming disease pertains to gastrointestinal issues. A \"slow pulse\" indicates a deficiency in the stomach. If the pulse is rapid, it typically suggests inflammation within or an obstruction in the intestines. If the pulse is rapid, one should inquire about bowel movements. If the response is affirmative and accompanied by diarrhea, it indicates the presence of deficient heat. \"Difficulty in achieving satiety\" means that even a small amount of food leads to a feeling of fullness. \"Slight agitation when full, dizziness, and difficulty in urination\" suggest the onset of \"jaundice.\" The majority of these symptoms arise from insufficient digestive secretions from the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas, leading to poor digestion in the gastrointestinal tract, which becomes deficient and cold. \"Slight agitation when full\" indicates that the contents in the stomach cannot be digested; the food remains distended in the stomach, causing a feeling of mild discomfort. Why does dizziness occur? After eating, nutrients are primarily supplied to the brain. If the stomach is deficient and cold, food cannot be digested, and there is no nutrient supply to the head, leading to symptoms of ischemia, hence the dizziness. When the digestive system is not functioning properly, urination will also be abnormal. \"Difficulty in urination\" does not necessarily refer to the volume being too much or too little; it may involve frequent urination with small amounts or just a few drops. Poor digestion, due to spleen dysfunction, leads to an accumulation of dampness, which tends to descend. Generally, dampness settles in the lower jiao, causing abdominal distension. If there is excessive dampness causing obstruction, urination will naturally decrease. If urination is normal, it indicates that dampness has...",

          "english_text": "Generally speaking, dampness tends to settle in the lower jiao, causing abdominal fullness. If there is excessive dampness blocking the pathways, urination will naturally decrease. If urination is normal, it indicates that the dampness is being expelled through the channels. The cause of deficiency and cold is excessive dampness within. When dampness is too heavy and accumulates internally, the entire body may appear yellow, which is referred to as \"jaundice.\" This occurs because the digestive system involves the secretions of the liver, spleen, and gallbladder for digestion. If the functions of the liver and spleen are compromised, and since the spleen governs dampness, the dampness will continue to increase. When the functions are poor, it leads to swelling. Although there may be fullness in the lower abdomen, if the dampness is expelled, the fullness should not persist. This abdominal fullness is due to spleen enlargement, with dampness trapped inside. The pulse will become very slow. If such swelling is present, the patient will definitely exhibit jaundice; it can even be said that a patient with jaundice must be suffering from dampness.\n\n#SECTION\n\n212. In \"Yangming disease,\" the treatment should involve promoting sweating, but if there is no sweat and the body feels as if insects are crawling under the skin, this is due to prolonged deficiency.\n\nYangming disease should typically involve a lot of sweating, which is not just sweating from the head but rather systemic sweating. Therefore, if there is systemic sweating without any apparent reason, it indicates Yangming disease; other conditions do not present with such sweating. Now, if there is no sweating, why is that? It is because there is internal deficiency, and the fluids of the gastrointestinal tract are depleted. \"If the body feels as if insects are crawling under the skin, this is due to prolonged deficiency.\" The fluids in the stomach should first reach the skin and then the exterior, but when fluids are insufficient, sweat may be produced in the sweat glands but does not escape through the pores, leading to itching beneath the skin. This type of itching causes the stomach's fluids to be depleted upon returning, so \"Gui Zhi Tang plus Huang Qi\" can be used.\n\nWang Hu stated: \"In cases of Yangming without sweating, it is still advisable to use 'Ge Gen Tang' as the primary treatment.\"",

I often say that sometimes you only need to place two leaves in front of your eyes to no longer see Mount Tai. The reason is that Western medicine observes viruses under a microscope and sees many different types of viruses, leading them to think that treating by killing the viruses is the solution. However, after you kill the first generation of viruses, the next generation becomes stronger, and thus you need to use stronger antibiotics to kill them. This results in a vicious cycle where one day it becomes impossible to kill these viruses, and once a patient is infected with such viruses and develops inflammation, it leads to death because there are no medicines left to treat them. \n\nFrom the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the appearance of the virus is not important; what matters is to expel all of them, driving the viruses out regardless of their type, sweeping them all away. Western medicine is very formalized and lacks spirit; at first glance, they seem correct, but in reality, their treatment makes the condition worse because their methods are incorrect.\n\nFor \"Phlegm in the diaphragm,\" the patient experiences wheezing and fullness, has a firm and distended feeling in the chest, a dark complexion, and a pulse that is deep and tight.

The symptoms include \"the person experiences shortness of breath and fullness,\" which occurs because there is an inability to properly digest food. As a result, fluids gradually accumulate, and after reaching a certain stage, these fluids will slowly seep out, ultimately concentrating in the area of the chest and diaphragm. This is the reason why some phlegm and fluid mixtures accumulate in the chest and diaphragm region. At this point, if you palpate the patient's stomach area and feel a hard lump, it is referred to as \"heart under pressure\" (心下痞堅). This actually indicates that undigested food has not been eliminated and has formed a hard mass in the stomach. The patient may exhibit a \"dark complexion,\" which signifies that the stomach qi is very weak, and the gastrointestinal system is unable to transport the nutrients from food to the face, resulting in a lack of luster. In simple terms, nutrients are not being supplied to the face, hence the dark complexion. This situation only reflects the accumulation of undigested food beneath the stomach; if it accumulates in the pancreas, the condition becomes even more severe. The patient may present with a \"deep and tight pulse,\" where \"deep\" indicates an internal condition and \"tight\" suggests coldness, while a wiry pulse tends to indicate water retention. \n\nIn the \"Treatise on Cold Damage\" (傷寒論), specifically in the section on the Lesser Yang (少陽篇), when discussing the Xiao Chai Hu Decoction (小柴胡湯), the pulse is described as wiry. The Xiao Chai Hu Decoction includes Ban Xia (半夏) to promote the expulsion of fluids, as Ban Xia can help drain dampness. \"If it persists for several tens of days, and the physician attempts to induce vomiting or purging without success,\" it indicates that the undigested food has remained in this location for too long, seeping into the gastric membrane. When it reaches this severe level, it gradually infiltrates as dampness. At this point, using methods of vomiting or purging is already too late; one must then resort to the use of Mu Fang Ji Decoction (木防己湯). \"If the condition is due to deficiency, it will resolve; if it is due to excess, it will relapse in three days. For those who do not recover, it is advisable to use Mu Fang Ji Decoction with gypsum, adding Poria and Glauber's salt as the main ingredients.\" This is because the condition has already progressed to the area between the patient's chest and diaphragm, causing the patient to experience shortness of breath and fullness.

          "english_text": "\"Deficiency and deficiency, supplementing the insufficient, and reducing the excessive. This is its meaning. The excess is stored accordingly.\" Following this reasoning, one must understand the concept of \"the superior practitioner treats the unmanifested disease,\" which is the original intent of Zhang Zhongjing. For example, when there are issues with the liver, we should first strengthen the spleen; this is the most fundamental principle. We do not allow liver disease to continue affecting the spleen, effectively confining the illness to the liver and preventing it from spreading further. This concept comes from Zhang Zhongjing and is rooted in the \"Neijing\" (Inner Canon), emphasizing that the highest level of Chinese medicine is to treat the unmanifested disease, whereas Western medicine treats the manifested disease. \n\nIt is akin to a couple preparing for divorce; when they go to the lawyer's office to sign the papers, this is referred to as \"the disease has already set in.\" In reality, there were many symptoms prior to the divorce indicating that if the situation continued to deteriorate, they would inevitably face divorce. At the point of having symptoms, the lawyer (representing Western medicine) does not intervene; rather, Chinese medicine steps in. \"There are symptoms!\" Therefore, we begin to take action. \n\nChinese medicine is based on pattern differentiation and treatment, which is what is meant by treating the unmanifested disease. If one waits until after falling ill to begin treatment, it is too late! The principles of the \"Neijing\" are broader than those of Western medicine, which is limited to localized issues within the organs. However, the \"Xiao Jian Zhong Tang\" (Minor Construct the Middle Decoction) is not a universal remedy for liver disease; misapplication of it could lead to significant misjudgment of the condition. \n\nXiao Jian Zhong Tang is only used for its sweet flavor to regulate the spleen and stomach, not for treating liver disease, because \"the liver's essence is inherently sour, while it contains bitter bile.\" The stomach is fundamentally the source of blood production. I mentioned when introducing the \"Shang Han Lun\" (Treatise on Cold Damage) that the source of blood is the spleen and stomach. After our intestines and stomach absorb food, \"the liver and gallbladder fluids seep into the stomach,\" where there are three components: the liver's sourness, the gallbladder's bitterness, and the spleen's sweetness.",

          "english_text": "This text discusses the functions of the spleen and stomach in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), particularly in relation to the liver and gallbladder. Here is the translation:\n\nIt pertains to the spleen and stomach. When our intestines and stomach absorb food, \"the fluids of the liver and gallbladder seep into the stomach.\" Inside the stomach, there are three components: the sourness from the liver, the bitterness from the gallbladder, and the sweetness from the spleen along with the mucus from the pancreas. If it is too cold, and our liver is affected by cold, we will vomit sour substances; therefore, when experiencing sour vomiting, we use drying methods to stop the vomiting. When a patient vomits sour substances, it indicates that liver fluids are being expelled, and we treat this with Wu Zhu Yu Decoction. If there is heat in the liver, then bile will be vomited, resulting in a bitter taste. \"Teacher, why do I wake up in the morning with a bitter mouth?\" This is due to bile rising, which corresponds to the Xiao Chai Hu Decoction syndrome. You are all quite familiar with this now; if the bitterness is severe, we need to increase the dosage of Huang Qin in Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, and also increase Ban Xia. Ban Xia can descend the rebellious qi and stop vomiting; in other words, when bile rises, we need to use Ban Xia to bring it down. Thus, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction can harmonize the stomach qi. \"When dampness prevails, the liver and gallbladder are not in harmony.\" The most difficult concept for people to understand in TCM is \"qi.\" What exactly is qi? Western medicine cannot see qi; it only observes the circulatory system, whether it is the lymphatic system or the blood circulation system. Western medicine does not recognize that it is qi that drives this circulatory system; its driving force is what TCM refers to as qi. If the qi of the liver and gallbladder is not sufficient, it means that the driving force of the liver and gallbladder is inadequate. The liver itself is the largest detoxifying organ in our body, and Western medicine acknowledges this as well. When we consume many substances, if liver function is not normal, the metabolic system will not function well, resulting in an inability to fully perform detoxification. In TCM, this condition is referred to as \"stagnation.\" Qi stagnation occurs in the liver, preventing it from moving properly. Normally, our body circulates blood throughout, along with residual substances...",

          "english_text": "The concept here refers to a condition known as \"stagnation\" or \"depression\" of Qi, where Qi becomes stagnant in the liver, preventing it from moving properly. Normally, our body circulates blood and residual toxins throughout the body back to the liver, where they are detoxified before being released into the heart. However, when liver Qi stagnates for an extended period, it can cause residual food toxins to accumulate, leading to the production of dampness. Once dampness is generated, patients may experience nausea. In fact, the stomach itself is not the issue; rather, it is the dampness stored in the liver that accumulates and compresses the stomach, resulting in nausea, which can lead to the expulsion of a significant amount of damp fluid. Sometimes, when patients wake up in the morning and brush their teeth, they may feel nauseous, which is caused by excessive internal dampness. Therefore, in general, when patients experience vomiting, it is often due to the presence of dampness within. As noted, \"When dampness prevails, the liver and gallbladder become unbalanced, leading to frequent vomiting.\" \n\nWhen dampness accumulates in the body for too long, the internal environment changes, making it very easy for parasites to develop. It is not necessary to consume food with visible pests; even pork left unattended can become infested simply due to excessive dampness. Thus, when our digestive system is not functioning well, food can remain in the body for too long, leading to spoilage and the potential for parasitic growth. \n\nTo nourish the liver, sour flavors are used, while bitter flavors assist in expelling dampness. At this time, Wu Mei Wan (Black Plum Pill) can be utilized. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, there are bitter herbs such as Huang Lian (Coptis) and Huang Qin (Scutellaria), which are cold and cooling in nature, primarily promoting downward movement and drainage. However, Wu Mei Wan, as prescribed by Zhang Zhongjing, employs a method that is not purely bitter and cold but rather utilizes a combination of bitter and warming properties. This is because warmth can transform dampness; only warmth can eliminate dampness. Therefore, Wu Mei Wan contains \"the sourness of Wu Mei (Black Plum), combined with the warmth of Xi Xin (Asarum), Gan Jiang (Dried Ginger), Shu Jiao (Sichuan Pepper), Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig), and Fu Zi (Aconite).\"",

For hysteria, Western medicine still does not have any effective drugs to treat this condition of hidden dryness.\n\nWhen a woman vomits saliva, if the physician purges her, it will lead to a feeling of fullness in the chest. The first step is to treat the vomiting of saliva; Xiao Qing Long Tang (Minor Blue Dragon Decoction) is the main prescription for this. Once the saliva stops, then the treatment for the fullness can be addressed, using Xie Xin Tang (Drain the Heart Decoction) as the main prescription.\n\nRegarding \"a woman vomiting saliva,\" the \"Nei Jing\" states: \"Saliva is vomited from the mouth when there is cold in the upper jiao.\" When a patient has cold in the upper jiao, they will vomit saliva; at this time, warming herbs should be used, such as Ma Xing Gan Shi Tang (Ephedra, Apricot Kernel, Licorice, and Gypsum Decoction) or Da Jian Zhong Tang (Major Construct the Middle Decoction), employing warming and dispersing methods. However, if a doctor mistakenly purges the patient, it can cause a feeling of fullness in the chest, as the cold descends and sinks below the stomach. Therefore, \"the first step is to treat the vomiting of saliva with Xiao Qing Long Tang,\" because the cold in the upper jiao causes the vomiting of saliva, and if the condition is attacked and purged, the cold will penetrate deeper. Thus, Xiao Qing Long Tang is used to disperse it. After taking Xiao Qing Long Tang, if the saliva stops, then the treatment can return to addressing the fullness caused by the mistaken purging with Xie Xin Tang.\n\nIn women's diseases, due to deficiency and accumulation of cold and qi stagnation, the flow of menstrual blood is obstructed, leading to years of cold accumulation at the entrance of the uterus. Cold injures the meridians, causing hardness and stagnation above, resulting in vomiting of saliva and prolonged lung atrophy, leading to physical deterioration.

Dried ginger is hotter than fresh ginger; it warms the interior, while fresh ginger disperses cold. Fresh ginger is used to hope that the medicine will disperse to the limbs after ingestion, thus it is used for dispersing the medicine to the extremities. If there is no fire left in the stomach, dried ginger is used to ignite the fire within the stomach, so it is considered a fire-stoking agent. This perspective can be taken into account.

The blood pulse refers to Yin, while the string represents cold, indicating that there is water phlegm obstructing it, which is why the string pulse can be felt. A weak pulse at the inch position (寸脈) indicates that the lung Qi cannot expand, being constrained in this area due to the presence of cold. When the wrist pulse feels very thin and string-like, it indicates the presence of cold water, and we can deduce that this person must have chest obstruction and pain. \"Therefore, it is attributed to extreme deficiency,\" as this indicates that the patient is in a state of extreme internal deficiency, leading to this phenomenon. \n\nIf there is excess in the chest cavity, Traditional Chinese Medicine differentiates between heat excess and cold excess. If it is heat excess, it signifies that something is obstructing inside and has already become inflamed. In this case, Zhang Zhongjing prescribed the formula \"Da Xianxiong Tang\" (大陷胸湯) in the \"Shang Han Lun.\" If it is cold excess blocking inside, he prescribed \"Sanwu Xiaobai San\" (三物小白散). This section discusses deficiency syndromes, as excess has already been addressed in the earlier parts of the \"Shang Han Lun.\" \n\nWhy is it \"attributed to extreme deficiency\"? This illness arises because the body's Yang is in a state of extreme deficiency, and the chest cavity governs Yang. We know that the disease is in the upper jiao, hence the chest obstruction and pain. The chest cavity is where Yang Qi gathers, and it should be abundant; therefore, in a healthy person, the pulse at the inch position should be stronger, while the wrist pulse should be smaller and more subdued. This is the normal condition. When the Qi of the lungs is depleted, we know that lung Qi has weakened, indicating lung deficiency, which means the upper jiao has become cold and deficient. \n\n\"Teacher, how do you know there is cold when it is deficient?\" Because the wrist pulse is string-like, we know there is cold inside. This first section describes how to use the pulse for diagnosis. \n\nA healthy person without cold or heat, with insufficient breath to sustain life, is considered to have excess. \n\nWhat does \"a healthy person without cold or heat\" mean?

In the section on chest obstruction, we only introduce treatments for deficiency conditions, without addressing excess conditions.\n\nThe disease of chest obstruction includes symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, chest and back pain, and shortness of breath. The pulse at the cun position is deep and slow, while the guan position is tight and rapid. The prescription for this condition is Guo Lou Xie Bai Bai Jiu Tang (Bottle Gourd, Chinese Garlic, and White Wine Decoction).\n\nGuo Lou Xie Bai Bai Jiu Tang formula:\nOne piece of mature bottle gourd, half a jin of Chinese garlic, and seven sheng of white wine. \n\nCombine these three ingredients, boil them together, and take two sheng, dividing it into warm doses for consumption.\n\nThis is a very mild prescription. If the patient experiences \"chest and back pain,\" it means that sometimes the chest pain radiates to the back, and at other times, the back pain feels like it penetrates to the front of the chest. However, it is not as intense as heart pain that radiates through the back; it is merely a slight, lingering ache. This is caused by the stagnation of Yang Qi in the chest, hence it is the mildest formula, Guo Lou Xie Bai Bai Jiu Tang. The mature bottle gourd resembles a loofah; if you cut it horizontally in the middle, it looks similar to a tomato. This gourd is used medicinally, and you should cut it into segments from the middle for use. If we use its root, it is known as Guo Lou Gen, also called Tian Hua Fen. The mature bottle gourd refers to using its fruit for medicinal purposes. When you go to the pharmacy to buy it, you might notice: \"Hey? Teacher, this looks like the heart's ventricles and atria.\" When viewed from the front, it appears this way, and there are seeds inside. If you observe it for three days...",

If you do not cook it for three days, when you peel it open, you may find small white worms crawling out. This is not a problem; it indicates that there are no pesticides. If a medicine is stored in the medicine cabinet for three years without any worms, then there is an issue with that medicine. It is like a glass of water that does not freeze even when taken to the North Pole—would you dare to drink it? If you did, wouldn't you become like an atomic bomb?

The primary function of Trichosanthes Fruit is to eliminate phlegm and fluids, and it is very effective in dispelling dampness. It can also open the lungs and promote the flow of Yang Qi, as noted in herbal texts, indicating that it can open the heart and lungs, thus benefiting the Yang Qi in the chest.\n\nWhy use Chinese Chives (Xie Bai)?

Once the turbid Qi is expelled by the Chinese Chives, we still need a guiding herb, which is white liquor. In the past, Cao Yingfu used sorghum liquor, which is also a type of white liquor; however, the drawback is that the alcohol is too strong, which may relieve chest obstruction but simultaneously harm the liver.

          "english_text": "When the blood from the organs rises, if the heart's blood is insufficient, the blood enters the brain but lacks the strength to continue flowing, resulting in blood stagnating in the upper part of the brain. Consequently, there is \"redness in the head and face,\" as the blood cannot descend. The reason for the blood not descending is due to insufficient blood in the posterior channels. Why do the lower limbs feel heavy? The blood in the veins of the lower limbs lacks the strength to return to the heart, which naturally leads to a feeling of heaviness. This is all caused by insufficient strength of the heart. In such cases, one can use Shao Yao Gan Cao Fu Zi Decoction.\n\nWhen there is \"pain in the heart accompanied by restlessness,\" this symptom arises from insufficient heart blood, causing pain within the heart and emotional agitation. This agitation is a type of vexation due to deficiency; when blood is insufficient, it can lead to dryness and heat, resulting in the patient experiencing pronounced restlessness.\n\nRegarding the \"jumping at the navel,\" why does this occur? When the blood vessels and veins in the lower jiao cannot fully return to the heart, the blood stagnates in the lower jiao and eventually presses against the navel. There is a major vein here that should flow back to the heart, and the most noticeable pulsation occurs here, indicating that the blood wants to return but can only reach the navel, after which it cannot fully ascend, thus it stagnates and begins to pulse. When you touch it, you can feel the blood vessels pulsating.\n\n\"The pulse is wiry; this is caused by heart injury.\" When our blood vessels are filled with blood, the pulse is robust and vigorous. Now, if the pulse becomes thin and wiry, it indicates blood deficiency and the presence of internal cold. Only those with deficiency and cold will exhibit this, which is a result of heart injury.\n\nIf you want to know if a person is naturally more prone to depression, you don't need to see them in person; you can tell by looking at their photo. If the eyes and eyebrows are very close together, it indicates a person who is unable to let go of things, and such patients are the hardest to treat.

Their problems cannot be resolved on their own, yet their minds wander into imagining many issues that do not exist in the world, questions that have no answers. Naturally, thinking about these half-formed ideas does not lead to solutions. Therefore, I often tell my patients: \"When you come to my clinic, your illness is my concern, not yours. Your responsibility is to take care of your wife and children, to do your job well, and to manage your home. Daydreaming about these issues is of no use.\" Patients do not understand medicine; they spend a long time just thinking. If \"thinking\" could cure diseases, then it would be fine to think, but such thoughts do not help and instead increase the burden on the physician. Thus, we often find ourselves treating conditions like spleen enlargement, gastric ptosis, kidney disease, or stroke, while the patient still suffers from emotional distress. In the process of treatment, we also need to address their emotional state, which leads to more complications.

          "english_text": "This is a condition of no return, known as the true heart pulse. When we detect the true heart pulse, it indicates that the heart itself governs a large and firm pulse. As we have introduced in the \"Neijing\" (Inner Canon), when we feel a certain type of true heart pulse in a patient, it signifies that there is a problem with that organ. Detecting this pulse means that the organ has lost its function; the true heart pulse is essentially a dead pulse.\n\nThe term \"evil crying\" refers to a state where the soul and spirit are unsettled, which is associated with a deficiency of blood and qi. A deficiency of blood and qi pertains to the heart. When the heart qi is deficient, the person experiences fear, closes their eyes wanting to sleep, dreams of distant journeys, and their spirit becomes scattered, leading to erratic behavior of the soul and spirit. A decline in yin qi results in mania, while a decline in yang qi leads to delirium.\n\nThe so-called \"evil crying\" describes a person who is weeping without cause. Why does this phenomenon occur? In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), it is believed to be due to an unsettled soul and spirit. The soul is associated with the liver, while the spirit is linked to the lungs. The liver governs blood, the lungs govern qi, and the heart houses the spirit, which oversees both the soul and spirit—this is the pathology in TCM. If both the soul and spirit are unstable, the issue lies within the heart, indicating a deficiency in both heart qi and blood. \"A deficiency of blood and qi pertains to the heart\" means that the root cause originates from the heart, leading to the unsettled state of the soul and spirit. Our soul and spirit can remain stable primarily because the heart's blood supply to the liver and lungs is sufficient. \n\n\"When the heart qi is deficient, the person experiences fear and closes their eyes wanting to sleep\" indicates that when the spirit is not anchored, fear arises, and the person feels afraid of everyone they see; for example, a person with a mental illness is described in TCM as having very deficient heart qi. \"Closing the eyes wanting to sleep\" means that the eyes are shut, and the person wishes to sleep, but they \"dream of distant journeys,\" which is exhausting. They are already fatigued, and now even in their dreams, they must undertake long journeys, making them even more tired.\n\nIn TCM, it is said that \"the spirit cannot govern the soul.\" The spirit itself is associated with stillness; when the spirit loses its stillness, it will...",

The 69th entry describes a situation after taking Ma Huang Tang, where the chest yang has diminished, leading to the sensation of heart palpitations below the heart. The 70th entry refers to excessive sweating from Gui Zhi Tang, resulting in a depletion of the stomach and intestinal fluids, causing insufficient water, which leads to a jumping sensation around the navel, preparing for a condition known as \"ben tun\" (running piglet syndrome). \n\nIn Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), heart palpitations below the heart do not indicate a clinical manifestation of the heart being in turmoil; rather, it refers to the area around \"Zhong Wan\" (the middle abdomen) pulsating. This occurs because the heavenly yang above has dried up, causing the water to be forcibly drawn upwards, leading to a blockage at \"Zhong Wan.\" At this time, \"Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang\" (Cinnamon Twig and Licorice Decoction) is used.\n\nIt is important to understand that the area around the navel has specific associations: the center of the navel corresponds to the spleen, the area above the navel corresponds to the kidneys, the area below the navel corresponds to the heart, the left side of the navel corresponds to the liver, and the right side corresponds to the lungs. For example, if there is palpitations above the navel, treatment should focus on the kidneys, and similarly for other areas.\n\nThe formula for Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang is as follows:\n- Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig) 4 taels (peeled)\n- Gan Cao (Licorice) 2 taels (roasted)\n\nCombine these two ingredients with 3 sheng (approximately 9 cups) of water, boil down to 1 sheng, strain, and take it in one dose. \n\nIf using 4 qian (approximately 12 grams) of Gui Zhi, then use 2 qian (approximately 6 grams) of Gan Cao, as Gui Zhi is twice the amount of Gan Cao. This is because excessive sweating has occurred, and Gan Cao replenishes the stomach's fluids. \n\nWhy is only Gui Zhi used and not Bai Shao (White Peony)? Why does palpitations occur? When drinking water, the stomach is very warm, and when the water enters the stomach, it vaporizes and becomes steam, not just water. If the water is stagnant at \"Zhong Wan,\" Gui Zhi, being very warming, will cause the water to evaporate upwards. Additionally, the outer membrane of the heart contains many nerve and blood vessels in the diaphragm; within the blood vessels is \"blood,\" and within the nerves...",

          "english_text": "Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig) promotes the evaporation of water upwards. Additionally, the outer membrane of the heart contains numerous nerve and blood vessels within the diaphragm and across the vascular system, where \"blood\" circulates, and in the nervous and lymphatic systems, \"water\" is present. When Gui Zhi is administered, it enhances the heart's ejection force, rapidly vaporizing the \"water\" that has stagnated beneath the heart. Palpitations occur because the \"water vapor\" that should rise is instead \"water\" itself, which is cold, leading to palpitations. At this moment, the combination of Gui Zhi and Gan Cao (Licorice) quickly vaporizes the water and distributes it to the limbs, alleviating the symptoms. This is quite similar to the Xiao Qing Long Tang (Minor Blue Dragon Decoction) syndrome, where water vapor beneath the heart is always accompanied by cough and wheezing. However, this decoction does not present with cough symptoms, so Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang (Cinnamon Twig and Licorice Decoction) is used for palpitations beneath the heart. This is due to excessive Yang, indicating Yang deficiency, which leads to palpitations; thus, Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang is appropriate for palpitations arising from Yang deficiency. Gui Zhi can descend and counteract rebellious Qi, which is why it is heavily utilized here. Later, Gui Zhi Jia Gui Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction with Additional Cinnamon) will also employ Gui Zhi's effect of descending rebellious Qi.\n\nIf Gui Zhi and Gan Cao are further combined with Fu Ling (Poria) and Da Zao (Jujube), it enhances the treatment. When sweating occurs, it expels the fluids from the gastrointestinal tract, causing the water in the lower jiao (lower abdomen) to surge upwards, resulting in \"palpitations below the navel.\" The force of the rebellious Qi is strong, indicating a water-related issue. When water is present in the lower jiao, it relies on Fu Ling to help expel the water, while Da Zao replenishes the gastrointestinal fluids. Therefore, the seventy cases indicate that excessive consumption of Gui Zhi Tang can lead to such phenomena, which typically do not occur unless there is stagnation of fluids in the lower jiao, particularly in individuals with heavier water retention.\n\nIn the case of the sixty-nine instances, if Ma Huang Tang (Ephedra Decoction) is consumed excessively, it can damage the fluids in the lungs, leading to palpitations beneath the heart.",

          "english_text": "The voice sounds like a saw, with a clear nasal discharge, and a sensation of fullness in the heart area. When the \"deficiency within\" moves like a galloping horse, this formula is appropriate.\n\nThe Da Qing Long Tang (Major Blue Dragon Decoction) is essentially the Ma Xing Gan Shi Tang (Ephedra, Apricot Kernel, Licorice, and Gypsum Decoction) with the addition of three ingredients: cinnamon (Gui), ginger (Jiang), and jujube (Zao), thus transforming it into Da Qing Long Tang. Therefore, Da Qing Long Tang addresses exterior syndromes, using Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig) and Ma Huang (Ephedra) to release the exterior. Ma Huang is used at six qian (a traditional weight measurement). In addition to clearing internal heat, it also resolves the exterior. \n\nThe distinction between Ma Xing Gan Shi Tang and Da Qing Long Tang lies in their treatment of asthma, which can also be due to heat. When asking the patient about their appetite, if the appetite is good, they should take Ma Xing Gan Shi Tang; if the appetite is poor, they should take Da Qing Long Tang, as ginger and jujube are appetite-stimulating herbs. When the medicine is taken, why does sweating occur? It relies on the fluids from the gastrointestinal tract to produce sweat. If the stomach function is impaired, there will still be fluids for sweating, which is how we classify these conditions.\n\nTreatment for asthma:\n1. Heat asthma: This is characterized by significant deficiency sweating in the patient, indicating yang deficiency. The tongue coating is yellow, and when asthma reaches the hands, it is mostly a deficiency syndrome, indicating that the asthma has persisted for a long time. For children, use a single needle without retention; the sound of phlegm during breathing is loud. Only needle, do not moxibustion. Points include \"Gong Sun\" and \"Nei Guan\" (for stomach and heart), \"San Li\" and \"Tai Bai\" (Earth generates Metal), \"Lin Qi\" and \"Tai Bai\" (Jia and Ji harmonize with Earth), the front point \"Yun Men\" and the back point \"Fei Shu.\" Generally, asthma patients will have a poor appetite, so also add \"Zhong Wan.\" The prescription will use variations of Da Qing Long Tang and Ma Xing Gan Shi Tang, depending on the appetite. If the patient enjoys drinking alcohol, use Gui Zhi Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction) with Hou Po (Magnolia Bark) and Xing Ren (Apricot Kernel).\n\n2. Cold asthma: The most commonly seen is cold asthma, especially in winter when patients cannot sleep and must sit up to rest. They expel white phlegm. The lung is associated with the Yin and Yang of the stomach and spleen, and this condition typically manifests between three and five o'clock in the morning.",

          "english_text": "The ten points indicate that excessive sweating from Gui Zhi Tang has depleted the fluids in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to insufficient water. This causes a sensation of jumping around the navel area, preparing for the onset of \"Ben Tun\" (a type of abdominal discomfort). In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the sensation of palpitations in the heart is not due to the heart itself being anxious, but rather the area around \"Zhong Wan\" (the middle abdomen) is pulsating. This occurs because the Yang energy above has dried up, causing the water to be forcibly drawn upwards, resulting in a blockage at \"Zhong Wan.\" At this time, \"Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang\" (Cinnamon Twig and Licorice Decoction) is used.\n\nIt is important to understand that the area around the navel corresponds to different organs: the center of the navel is associated with the spleen, the area above the navel corresponds to the kidneys, the area below the navel relates to the heart, the left side of the navel corresponds to the liver, and the right side corresponds to the lungs. For example, if there are palpitations above the navel, treatment should focus on the kidneys, and similarly for other areas.\n\n#FORMULA\nGui Zhi Gan Cao Tang Recipe:\n- Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig) 4 liang (approximately 150 grams, peeled)\n- Gan Cao (Licorice) 2 liang (approximately 75 grams, roasted)\n\nCombine these two ingredients with 3 sheng (approximately 900 ml) of water, boil down to 1 sheng (approximately 300 ml), strain, and take it in one dose.\n\nIf using 4 qian (approximately 15 grams) of Gui Zhi, then use 2 qian (approximately 7.5 grams) of Gan Cao, as Gui Zhi is twice the amount of Gan Cao. This is because excessive sweating has occurred, and Gan Cao enters the stomach to replenish its fluids. Why is only Gui Zhi used and not Bai Shao (White Peony)? Why do palpitations occur? When water is normally ingested, the stomach is very warm, and when the water enters the stomach, it vaporizes into gas rather than remaining as liquid. If the water is stagnant at \"Zhong Wan,\" Gui Zhi, being very warming, will cause the water to evaporate upwards. Additionally, the outer membrane of the heart contains many nerve and blood vessels in the diaphragm; within the blood vessels is \"blood,\" while in the nervous and lymphatic systems is \"water.\" When Gui Zhi is administered, it enhances the heart's pumping force, quickly vaporizing the \"water\" that has stagnated in the heart area. The palpitations occur because what should have been \"water vapor\" is now obstructed.",

          "english_text": "The complexion is pale and thin, which is different from the \"young gentleman's face\" described in the book on physiognomy. What is a \"young gentleman's face\"? It refers to a face that appears oily and smooth, without wrinkles. One might wonder, \"Is this person not using any oil? Why does their face look oily?\" This is what is meant by a \"young gentleman's face.\" The pattern of a young gentleman's face is not favorable; it lacks a solid foundation. The term \"thin complexion\" here is unrelated to the young gentleman's face; it indicates a deficiency of qi and blood in the body. \n\n\"Mainly thirsty\" means that the patient feels very thirsty. At this time, regardless of whether the thirst is caused by diabetes or some other condition, as long as the patient experiences thirst, it signifies a deficiency of body fluids. Why does a deficient person feel thirsty? Because the yin within is deficient, leading to an excess of yang. Some patients may be both deficient and hot, but this heat actually arises from yin deficiency, not from excess heat. If it were excess heat, we would need to use Bai Hu Tang (White Tiger Decoction) or Cheng Qi Tang (Purge the Qi Decoction) to attack it. However, the thirst caused by deficient heat is different; if there is nothing to attack, how can we proceed? At this time, the deficient heat generated by the patient can still produce a high temperature, which will evaporate body fluids, causing thirst.\n\nIn such situations, we need to prescribe herbs to tonify the deficiency as well as herbs to clear heat. If we only prescribe herbs to clear excess heat, for example, if we administer Da Cheng Qi Tang (Major Order the Qi Decoction), the heat may be eliminated, but the deficiency will worsen. Therefore, deficiency conditions must never be treated with aggressive methods.\n\nIf the patient has excess heat, meaning they have strong and robust heat, and you prescribe herbs to clear deficient heat, such as tonifying herbs, the excess will only become more pronounced. Traditional Chinese Medicine requires the ability to discern yin and yang, exterior and interior, deficiency and excess, cold and heat; it is merely a matter of differentiating symptoms in this way. \n\nWhen \"asthma and palpitations\" suddenly occur, it indicates that the patient is experiencing sudden shortness of breath, which signifies a deficiency of qi. Why does this happen? When a person...",

          "english_text": "Heat is simply diagnosed in this way. When a patient suddenly experiences \"palpitations,\" it indicates a sudden onset of shortness of breath, which signifies insufficient Qi. Why does this happen? When there is deficiency in the body, the function of the gastrointestinal system must be poor; the spleen cannot generate the metal (referring to the lungs), and the fluids in the lungs are supplied by the pancreas and spleen. The spleen absorbs nutrients and then delivers them to the lungs. When the spleen's function is compromised, the patient will experience sudden shortness of breath, indicating a deficiency of Qi, which leads to this condition. Palpitations, in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), are also referred to as \"blood deficiency.\" Therefore, one is Qi deficiency, and the other is blood deficiency. The symptom of palpitations indicates that the heart lacks strength, which causes the palpitations; in TCM, this is termed blood deficiency. The \"floating pulse\" is because the exterior of the pulse represents Qi; when you feel it, you are sensing the Qi pulse, not the blood pulse. Yang represents Qi, while blood represents Yin. When blood is insufficient, Yang rises to the surface, resulting in a pulse that feels large and floating; in reality, the patient is suffering from blood deficiency.\n\nFor men, a pulse that is weak, deep, and wiry, without signs of cold or heat, accompanied by shortness of breath and urgency, difficulty in urination, a pale complexion, occasional eye closure, and a fullness in the lower abdomen, indicates a condition caused by overexertion.\n\nHere, several symptoms unique to overexertion are presented, and the practitioner categorizes them. If a man has a \"weak, deep, and wiry pulse,\" a weak pulse is one where you can feel a slight pulse, but when pressed harder, it disappears; this is called a weak pulse. Alternatively, the pulse may be very deep, only palpable near the bone, and again disappears with firm pressure. Or, you may feel a very thin pulse, resembling a string; this is also a weak pulse. In other words, the weak, deep, and wiry pulses all indicate a deficiency of both Qi and blood within. The first situation is that the patient does not exhibit signs of cold or heat. When you ask him, \"Do you feel cold? Do you feel hot?\" he replies, \"No.\" \"Shortness of breath and urgency\" means that sometimes the patient feels breathless when moving slightly.",

          "english_text": "There are no cold or heat phenomena. When you ask the patient, \"Do you feel cold? Do you feel hot?\" they respond, \"No.\" \"Shortness of breath with urgency\" indicates that the patient sometimes has difficulty breathing even with slight movement, and they often experience abdominal bloating and pain. \"Difficult urination\" refers to frequent urination with a small volume. \"Pale complexion\" indicates a sallow appearance. The patient often feels dizzy and may also experience \"epistaxis,\" which means they frequently have nosebleeds. Generally speaking, symptoms like difficult urination suggest that there is a problem with kidney function. A pale complexion indicates an issue with spleen function, as the color of the face is derived from the functioning of the spleen and stomach. Nosebleeds suggest a problem with the liver. Why do we discuss these symptoms? The main reason is to inform everyone that when such conditions arise, it indicates that the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys are all deficient. However, when you observe the patient, they may appear quite normal, yet all five organs are simultaneously deficient. This is known as \"labor syndrome,\" as \"this is caused by labor.\" These symptoms arise when there is simultaneous deficiency in the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys.\n\nIn the case of labor syndrome as a disease, the pulse is floating and large, the hands and feet feel restless, symptoms are severe in spring and summer, and milder in autumn and winter. The deficiency of yin leads to spontaneous heat, and there is soreness and weakness that prevents movement. \n\nFor patients with labor syndrome, when they become ill, the pulse is \"floating and large,\" accompanied by \"restlessness in the hands and feet,\" indicating that both the hands and feet exhibit signs of agitation. \"Severe in spring and summer, milder in autumn and winter\" means that this restlessness worsens during the warmer seasons, while it improves in the colder months. This is primarily because individuals with labor syndrome inherently have yin deficiency, which causes yang to rise. During the warmer spring and summer months, the internal deficiency heat interacts with the external heat from the environment, leading to discomfort for the patient. In winter, the symptoms tend to improve due to the colder external temperatures.",

The 69th entry refers to the sweating induced by Ma Huang Tang, which results in the loss of chest yang, leading to the sensation of heart palpitations below the heart. The 70th entry refers to excessive sweating from Gui Zhi Tang, which depletes the stomach and intestines of fluids, causing insufficient water. This leads to a sensation of pulsation around the navel area, preparing for the onset of \"ben tun\" (a type of abdominal discomfort). \n\nIn Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), heart palpitations below the heart do not indicate that the heart itself is in distress, but rather that the area around \"Zhong Wan\" (the middle abdomen) is pulsating. This occurs because the heavenly yang above has dried up, causing the fluids to be drawn upwards, resulting in a blockage at \"Zhong Wan.\" At this time, \"Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang\" (Cinnamon Twig and Licorice Decoction) is used.\n\nIt is important to understand that the area around the navel has specific associations: the center of the navel corresponds to the spleen, the area above the navel corresponds to the kidneys, the area below the navel corresponds to the heart, the left side of the navel corresponds to the liver, and the right side corresponds to the lungs. For example, if there are palpitations above the navel, treatment should focus on the kidneys, and similarly for other areas.\n\nThe formula for Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang is as follows:\n- Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig) 4 taels (peeled)\n- Gan Cao (Licorice) 2 taels (roasted)\n\nCombine these two ingredients with 3 sheng (approximately 9 cups) of water, boil down to 1 sheng, strain, and take it all at once. \n\nIf using 4 qian (approximately 12 grams) of Gui Zhi, then use 2 qian (approximately 6 grams) of Gan Cao, as Gui Zhi is twice the amount of Gan Cao. This is because excessive sweating has occurred, and Gan Cao replenishes the stomach's fluids. \n\nWhy is only Gui Zhi used and not Bai Shao (White Peony)? Why are there palpitations? When drinking water, the stomach is very hot, and when the water enters the stomach, it vaporizes and becomes steam rather than remaining as water. If the water is stagnant at \"Zhong Wan,\" Gui Zhi, being very warming, will cause the water to evaporate upwards. Additionally, the outer membrane of the heart has many nerves and blood vessels in the diaphragm; within the blood vessels is \"blood,\" and within the nerves...",

          "english_text": "Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig) descends and causes the evaporation of water to rise. Additionally, the outer membrane of the heart contains numerous nerve and blood vessels in the diaphragm and intercostal areas. In the blood vessels, there is \"blood,\" while in the nervous and lymphatic systems, there is \"water.\" When Gui Zhi descends, it strengthens the heart's ejection force, quickly vaporizing the \"water\" that has stagnated beneath the heart. Palpitations occur because the \"water vapor\" that should rise is instead \"water\" that comes up, and this water is cold, leading to palpitations. At this time, the combination of Gui Zhi and Gan Cao (Licorice) immediately vaporizes the water and sends it to the limbs, alleviating the symptoms. This is very similar to the Xiao Qing Long Tang (Minor Blue Dragon Decoction) syndrome, where there is water vapor beneath the heart, which is always accompanied by cough and wheezing. However, this decoction does not have cough symptoms, so Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang (Cinnamon Twig and Licorice Decoction) is used when there are palpitations beneath the heart. This is because excessive yang leads to yang deficiency, and palpitations caused by yang deficiency are treated with Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang. Gui Zhi can descend the counterflow, which is why it is heavily utilized here. Later, Gui Zhi Jia Gui Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction with Additional Cinnamon) will also be used to leverage the effect of Gui Zhi in descending the counterflow.\n\nIf Gui Zhi and Gan Cao are further combined with Fu Ling (Poria) and Da Zao (Jujube), it becomes even more effective. When sweating occurs, it expels the fluids from the gastrointestinal tract, and the water from the lower jiao rushes upward, resulting in \"palpitations beneath the navel.\" The force of the rebellious qi is strong, and it is all a water issue. When water is in the lower jiao, it relies on Fu Ling to expel the water and on Da Zao to replenish the fluids in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, the seventy cases indicate that Gui Zhi Tang was consumed excessively; normally, this phenomenon does not occur. Most cases involve individuals with stagnant fluids in the lower jiao, where water vapor is heavier and stagnates in the lower jiao.\n\nIn the case of the sixty-nine instances, it has been observed that if Ma Huang Tang (Ephedra Decoction) is taken excessively, it can damage the fluids in the lungs, leading to palpitations beneath the heart.",

Therefore, when children have a fever and experience a nosebleed, the fever may resolve. Children often have strong Yang Qi, and sometimes when they catch a cold, a nosebleed can lead to the resolution of the fever. When we see that the nosebleed has occurred, it indicates that the patient has recovered, and prescribing Ma Huang Tang again would be excessive.\n\nIn clinical practice, there is a case involving two carpenter brothers who, on a hot day, brought their father, wrapped in a cotton quilt, to the clinic for treatment. They reported that he had suffered a stroke for a week. Upon examination, I determined it was a Ma Huang Tang syndrome and decided to use Ma Huang Tang, thinking that Zhang Zhongjing would not deceive me. To be cautious, I called the next day to verify, only to find out from the family that he was not at home; he had gone out to play. When I asked the family how many bowls of Ma Huang Tang he had consumed, they replied that he had only drunk one bowl. The effect of the medicine was that quick, and he slept very well after taking Ma Huang Tang, without experiencing insomnia due to the Ma Huang. Although he had not improved after eight or nine days, regardless of whether the diagnosis was a stroke or a cold, as long as it was still a Ma Huang Tang syndrome, I would continue to use Ma Huang Tang. This exemplifies the principle of differentiation and treatment based on symptoms.",

In this case, Ma Huang Tang is not needed. It is commonly seen in children, especially boys, who are very active and run around. While the mother is still preparing Ma Huang Tang, the child experiences a nosebleed and recovers, so there is no need to be overly anxious; the bleeding will stop on its own.

If the sweat does not flow out completely, it then transitions to \"Yangming.\" If there is still slight sweating without aversion to cold, it indicates that the \"Taiyang\" disease has not resolved. In this case, purging is contraindicated, as it would be counterproductive; thus, a small amount of sweating can be induced. If the complexion is bright red, it indicates that Yang Qi is constrained on the surface, and it should be resolved and diffused. If sweating is insufficient and does not flow out completely, Yang Qi is constrained and cannot be released. In this situation, the person may feel restless, unable to pinpoint the pain, which may shift between the abdomen and the limbs.

Gradually, as the time for the Taiyang syndrome passes, the heat pathogen transitions to the Yangming stage, where \"slight sweating continues without aversion to cold.\" In the case of Yangming syndrome, sweating may still occur because the fluids from the intestines continue to flow outward. However, Yangming syndrome does not present with cold symptoms but rather with heat symptoms, and the exterior symptoms have already resolved, moving inward. In this situation, \"if the Taiyang disease has not resolved, purging is contraindicated.\" One must first assess whether the patient is in the Yangming or Taiyang stage by asking if they still fear wind. If the answer is yes, do they fear cold? If yes, are they sweating? If the answer is yes, it indicates that the exterior syndrome has not yet resolved.",

If you induce too much sweat, the result is that the wind is expelled, but the dampness remains, because the patient does not only have wind symptoms. \"If the wind is gone but the dampness remains,\" then recovery will not occur. \"If treating wind-damp, and the patient only slightly feels the urge to sweat, both wind and dampness will be eliminated.\" This means that the patient feels as if they are about to sweat profusely, but upon examination, you find that they have only produced a thin layer of sweat; this indicates that the sweating has been effectively induced. Therefore, the dosage of the prescription must be carefully controlled, as this is a standard principle in TCM for treating wind-damp conditions. \n\nIn the past, everyone learned from the \"Treatise on Cold Damage,\" which discusses purely exterior wind. Guizhi Decoction is used to dispel wind; however, how should we handle patients with wind-damp conditions? Later, we will differentiate several situations and use different prescriptions accordingly. Why must the prescriptions be differentiated? Because dampness manifests in different locations, different prescriptions must be employed.\n\nFor those with dampness, the body experiences pain and fever, the face is yellow and short of breath, there is headache and nasal congestion accompanied by irritability, and the pulse is large. They can still eat and their abdomen is harmonious without disease; the illness is due to cold dampness in the head, hence the nasal congestion. Internal medication for the nose will then be effective.\n\n\"For those with dampness, the body experiences pain, fever, the face is yellow and short of breath, headache, nasal congestion, and irritability.\" How do we initially determine that this patient belongs to the damp category? It’s simple: \"Stick out your tongue for me to see.\" Upon examination, if the person's tongue is yellow, thick, and the coating is sticky and thick, with a lot of sticky saliva in the mouth, this indicates they belong to the damp category. If the patient presents with \"a yellow face and shortness of breath, headache, nasal congestion, and irritability, with a large pulse and the ability to eat, and the abdomen is harmonious without disease,\" this ability to eat indicates that the middle jiao is harmonious.",

Dampness in this area can lead to nasal congestion. Due to the sticky nature of dampness, it can block the nose, causing the patient to wheeze and struggle to breathe, resorting to mouth breathing. In this situation, we recognize that dampness exists within the nose, similar to what Western medicine refers to as sinusitis or nasal purulence, among other terms. \n\n\"Internal medicine will cure the nose.\" According to Zhong Shi, at this time, the medicine should be applied directly into the nose for the best effect. Since the patient's dampness is only accumulated in the nose, we only need to address the dampness there. If the medicine is taken orally, it will go to the stomach, which will delay treatment significantly compared to directly spraying the medicine into the nose. Therefore, when treating sinusitis, in addition to acupuncture, we generally do not need to use oral prescriptions but should use a nasal spray.\n\nIf we use acupuncture, we can select the Yingxiang point. If there is purulent discharge from the nose, with a lot of nasal mucus, we can perform moxibustion on the Shangxing point, which is also a major point for nasal conditions. Baihui and Qianding can also be used to treat nasal diseases. Points on the back such as Fengchi and Feishu can also be used for nasal conditions, as the lungs open to the nose.\n\nWhen you needle the Yingxiang point, if the nasal congestion does not clear immediately, it indicates that you have not successfully targeted the Yingxiang point. Therefore, if you do not feel anything when the needle is inserted, do not doubt the acupuncture technique; rather, it may be that your technique needs improvement.",

Zhang Zhongjing mentioned, \"In cases of dampness, if the body feels heavy and painful, Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang can be used to induce sweating.\" This is because the patient already has dampness internally; typically, after sweating, the dampness can be resolved. When dampness is inside the body, there are usually no noticeable symptoms. However, once the Ma Huang Tang syndrome is present, the cold constricts the exterior, leading to pain. The reason is that the dampness in the body cannot disperse through the skin's surface. This dampness originates from the lungs and reaches the skin's surface. When the skin's surface is affected by cold, it is essential to open the patient's pores to expel the cold, which relies on Ma Huang Tang. Once Ma Huang Tang is administered, it will induce sweating. However, if the patient has significant dampness, as mentioned by Zhang Zhongjing, sweating in cases of dampness may allow the wind to escape while the dampness remains, correct? Therefore, it is necessary to add Bai Zhu (Atractylodes) to the formula. Bai Zhu is effective in dispelling dampness, while Ma Huang Tang is used to expel exterior cold. If there is internal cold-dampness, this medication should not be relied upon, allowing everyone to differentiate accordingly. Thus, if it is determined that the patient has exterior cold-dampness, there will definitely be a lack of sweating. When the patient already exhibits Ma Huang Tang syndrome, we know that sweating is required. However, if you encounter a patient with Ma Huang Tang syndrome who has generalized joint pain and you also notice significant dampness, you should not simply prescribe Ma Huang Tang; you need to add Bai Zhu to the formula. \n\nMa Huang Jia Zhu Tang is also indicated in cases of jaundice, when the skin appears yellow. When there is a yellow, dark yellow, or yin yellow complexion, we also use Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang. Why is this? Because the damp-heat in the lungs is inherent to our body. When dampness is present in the upper jiao (the lungs), the lungs themselves are the area where heat is dissipated. When...",

Zhang Zhongjing stated that after drinking Chengqi Decoction, the patient will feel thirsty, and drinking some water will resolve this. This differentiation explains that although it is clearly observed that the patient has diarrhea, one might mistakenly think that there is no blockage inside. In reality, the patient experiences diarrhea due to internal blockage, as the blockage is too severe.\n\nIn cases of febrile disease, when the intestines are dry and bowel movements are difficult, it is often resolved with decoctions. The stimulation and propulsion from the medicinal substances can indeed facilitate bowel movements, and the fluids also assist in this process; for instance, drinking plenty of water can help with bowel movements. However, if pills are used, especially those made from pungent and hot substances, they only possess the power to stimulate intestinal peristalsis without the ability to moisten the intestinal walls. Therefore, the resulting excretion often contains a lot of residual moisture, which is why Western medications or glycerin tablets cannot induce the production of bodily fluids in the intestines and stomach.\n\n#SECTION\n\n119. \"Taiyang disease\" that does not resolve indicates a heat accumulation in the bladder, causing the person to appear manic, with blood flowing downward, and those who have this condition will improve.

Once the exterior is resolved, if there is still urgent distension in the lower abdomen, then it is appropriate to attack, and \"Taohua Hexing Decoction\" should be used.\n\n\"Taiyang disease not resolving\" means that there are still exterior symptoms of Taiyang disease, and the exterior heat has not dissipated. When Gui Zhi Decoction, Ge Gen Decoction, or Ma Huang Decoction are used to release the exterior but do not succeed, the pathogen can directly enter the interior through the meridians, penetrating the bladder from the surface of the skin. The bladder is located at the front of the abdomen, with the Jingong (reproductive organs) in the middle and the large intestine at the back. Normally, the water that is expelled in urine is vaporized; during vaporization, part of the water moves into the gallbladder, where water generates wood and transforms into bile. The process of vaporization is inherently hot, and when this heat enters the bladder, it transfers heat to the bladder, affecting the Taiyang bladder meridian. If the heat becomes excessive, the blood vessels may rupture, leading to the expulsion of urine.\n\n--- \n\nThis translation maintains the original meaning and technical precision of the TCM concepts presented in the text.",

If the heat continues to increase, the blood vessels may rupture, leading to blood in the urine. This is a manifestation of an external condition that has not been resolved, which then affects the internal state. Another scenario is when one gets injured from a fight or sports, affecting the area related to urination, resulting in a blockage that prevents urination, leading to internal blood stasis. This is also considered an external injury, and the formula used is Peach Pit Decoction (Tao He Cheng Qi Tang). \n\nHeat accumulation in the bladder manifests as excessively hot urine with blood. Peach Pit Decoction is the first prescription for treating blood-related conditions and is a relatively simple formula. The phrase \"the person appears manic\" does not mean they are truly insane; rather, it indicates a state of agitation and restlessness. If one were truly insane, it would be too late for Peach Pit Decoction to be effective, so this describes a state close to mania but not fully reached. \n\n\"Blood flows downward; if it flows down, it is better.\" If at this moment, blood is expelled with the urine, it is not a concern, as the blood has been released. \"If the exterior condition is not resolved, it is not yet appropriate to attack; one should first resolve the exterior.\" To resolve the exterior, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is used, as it must pass through the middle Jiao when addressing issues related to the \"fu\" organs. \n\nOnce the exterior is resolved, but there is still urgent tightness in the lower abdomen, which refers to the areas around \"Zhongji\" and \"Guanyuan,\" feeling very tight, causing significant pain and discomfort, and preventing urination.

          "english_text": "If there is exterior heat that has not resolved, when using Gui Zhi Tang, Ge Gen Tang, or Ma Huang Tang to release the exterior, if the pathogen does not disperse, the virus can directly enter the interior through the meridians and penetrate into the organs, entering the bladder directly from the surface of the skin. The bladder is located at the front of the abdomen, with the Jing Gong (the essence palace) in the middle and the large intestine behind it. Normally, the urine that is excreted is vaporized; during the vaporization process, part of the water moves into the gallbladder, where water generates wood and transforms into bile. The process of vaporization is inherently hot. When this heat enters the bladder, it transfers heat to the bladder, affecting the Taiyang Bladder Meridian, which connects to the bladder. If the heat becomes excessive, it can cause the blood vessels to rupture, leading to hematuria (blood in urine). This is a phenomenon where an external condition that has not resolved transmits to the interior. \n\nAnother scenario is when there is trauma from a fight, a kick, or sports injury affecting the area related to urination, resulting in urinary obstruction due to internal bruising. This is also considered an external injury, for which Tao He Cheng Qi Tang (Peach Pit Decoction to Order the Qi) is used. Heat accumulation in the bladder manifests as excessively hot urine, which may also be accompanied by blood. Tao He Cheng Qi Tang is the first formula for treating blood conditions and is a relatively simple prescription. \n\n\"When the person appears manic\" does not mean they are truly insane; rather, it indicates that their emotions are very agitated and restless. If they were truly insane, it would be too late for Tao He Cheng Qi Tang, so this describes a state close to mania but not fully reached. \"Blood flows downward; when it flows down, it is resolved.\" If at this time the urine naturally contains blood, it is not a concern, as the blood has been cleared. \n\n\"For those whose exterior condition has not resolved, it is not yet appropriate to attack; one should first resolve the exterior.\" To resolve the exterior, Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Minor Bupleurum Decoction) is used, as it must pass through the middle jiao (the central burner) when addressing issues related to the \"fu\" (the organs). \n\n\"Once the exterior is resolved, but there is still urgent distension in the lower abdomen,\" the lower abdomen refers to the area around \"Zhong Ji\" and \"Guan Yuan,\" which feels very tight. The patient experiences significant pain and discomfort, and they are unable to urinate. The skin in this area also appears very tense.",

          "english_text": "The abdomen is very tight around the \"Zhongji\" and \"Guanyuan\" areas, causing the patient significant pain and discomfort. They may also experience difficulty urinating, and the skin appears taut and tense, with overall cramping. From these symptoms, it can be determined that there is blood stagnation in the bladder, preventing the blood from descending.\n\nStagnant blood refers to blood that has leaked out of the blood vessels, losing its functional properties and becoming \"dead blood,\" which is termed as \"stagnant blood\" in medical terminology. Dead blood not only loses its physiological function but can also harm the entire body. It can transform into toxic substances, stimulating the brain's nerves and causing confusion, or lead to unclean blood, resulting in various pathological changes such as skin diseases, ulcers, tidal fever, as well as aggressive and migratory pain conditions. All acute and chronic diseases, along with strange and unusual ailments that do not improve over time, are likely associated with stagnant blood. We have many methods to teach how to identify and recognize the presence of blood stagnation. \n\nFormulas such as Taohua Chengqi Decoction, Xie Yuxue Decoction, Didang Wan Decoction, Guizhi Fuling Wan, and Dahuang Chanchong Wan are all effective remedies for treating stagnant blood. Guizhi Fuling Wan is specifically used for women with uterine fibroids or ovarian tumors. Dahuang Chanchong Wan is used when there is stagnant blood in the abdominal cavity, while Xie Yuxue Decoction is applied when there is stagnant blood causing internal injuries in the thoracic cavity.\n\nIn clinical practice, when encountering lower abdominal pain, it is important to first inquire about the normalcy of urination. For example, if a woman seeks treatment for abdominal pain during her menstrual period and you forget to ask about her urination, you might mistakenly assume the pain is caused by menstruation. In reality, it could be due to a bladder stone causing abdominal pain during that time, leading to an incorrect prescription.\n\nTaohua Chengqi Decoction formula:\n- 50 pieces of peach kernel (peeled and pointed)\n- 2 taels of cinnamon twig\n- 4 taels of rhubarb\n- 2 taels of Glauber's salt\n- 2 taels of licorice (prepared)",

Rehmannia is for tonifying deficiency, and using five qian will not provide sufficient nourishment. Boil with five bowls of water until three bowls remain, drink the first bowl, and do not drink again if there is a \"down\" reaction, which refers to passing blood. Do not be anxious; the fetus in the abdomen will not be harmed.\n\nThe definition of the original formula by Dong Dongweng states: \"To treat those with blood stasis, there are two types of blood stasis. One is when there is pain in the lower abdomen and frequent urination; the other is when the abdomen feels full but the person perceives fullness. For urgent cases, use decoction; for less urgent cases, use pills.\" Difficulty in urination indicates blood stasis in the bladder, which corresponds to the Peach Kernel Chengqi Decoction. Frequent urination corresponds to the Didao Decoction. Additionally, if the abdomen feels soft to the touch and the patient feels discomfort in the abdomen, this is also a blood condition. For urgent cases, use decoctions; for less urgent cases, use pills. Generally speaking, if the condition is superficial, the pain will be very acute; if the condition is deeper, the pain will be less urgent. Therefore, pills are used. Why use pills? Pills are characterized by their \"gentle and focused medicinal power.\" For \"acute conditions,\" it is necessary to expel quickly, hence the use of decoctions. Decoctions are for cleansing; for gastrointestinal issues, powdered medicines are preferable.\n\nThe \"Fang Yu Nao\" states: \"In cases of upper symptoms, those with a weak constitution are often afflicted. A weak constitution, even with blood stasis in the lower abdomen, should not be attacked. However, if not attacked, the illness will not resolve. Well said! Chen Ziming modified this formula by removing 'rhubarb' and adding 'rehmannia,' naming it 'Tongjing Pills.' This slight modification effectively addresses the need to balance attack and tonification, which is not surpassed even by the military strategies of Sun Wu. I have used these four ingredients, decocted in water, to treat 'dry blood labor' with great efficacy.\" \"Dry blood labor\" refers to blood that has dried up in the abdominal cavity, with the patient exhibiting symptoms such as \"skin peeling.\" This is often seen in young girls, particularly on the legs and abdomen, and occurs every winter when the skin sheds.",

This manifests as shedding skin on the legs and abdomen during winter, where the skin becomes dry and resembles snake skin, while in summer, it appears normal. This condition is essentially \"dry blood deficiency.\"\n\n139. \"Taiyang disease\" presents with jaundice, a deep and tight pulse, hardness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, indicating a lack of blood. If urination is smooth, the person may appear manic, which is a sign of blood stasis; \"Dingdang Decoction\" is indicated for this condition.\n\nThis can be further divided into two categories: one with smooth urination and one with difficulty in urination, to differentiate between blood presence and absence. If there is no blood, the patient exhibits jaundice, a deep and tight pulse, hardness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, indicating a lack of blood. In such cases, \"Yinchenhao Decoction\" will be used. Yinchenhao Decoction specifically targets heat in the bladder. When there is heat burning below, after the bladder has been vaporized, some unhealthy urine is expelled while some good fluid enters the gallbladder, aiding in digestion through bile secretion. Bile is yellow; if there is excessive heat in the bladder, the secretion of bile becomes too hot, leading to jaundice in the patient. \n\nDo not underestimate blood stasis; it may not be visible on X-rays, yet it can lead to manic behavior in patients. This stasis can sometimes travel to the brain. Depending on the situation, either \"Dachengqi Decoction\" or \"Dingdang Decoction\" may be used. Therefore, it is essential to observe the urination patterns. If urination is smooth, \"Dingdang Decoction\" is appropriate. If the urine is very yellow, it indicates excessive heat in the lower jiao, and if there is constipation, \"Dachengqi Decoction\" should be used to purge.\n\n140. In \"Shanghan\" (cold damage), if there is heat, fullness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, but the urination is now normal, it indicates the presence of blood. Immediate purging is necessary, and no residual medicine should be left; \"Dingdang Pill\" is recommended. \n\nHeat accumulation in the bladder should typically result in difficulty urinating; however, if urination is normal, and the patient reports pain in the lower abdomen around the \"Zhongji\" and \"Guanyuan\" areas, the pain is due to obstruction. If urination is good, it indicates that blood is blocked.",

The difficulty in urination may be due to kidney stones, and the use of Wuling San (Five-Ingredient Powder) can help resolve this. Currently, the patient is feeling intense pain, but upon palpation, the abdomen is soft, suggesting that there is stagnant blood inside. To differentiate whether there is blood stagnation, we assess the ease of urination. It is advised that \"no additional medicine should be used; it is appropriate to use Diding Wan (Resisting the Pathogen Pill).\" Other medications are ineffective; Diding Wan must be used. The symptoms appear milder compared to those treated with Diding Tang (Resisting the Pathogen Decoction), but the dosage remains the same.

If blood is expelled, it should be taken immediately; if not, take more. The peach kernel is very sticky, and the crushed leech is also sticky, so they are divided into four pills. Generally, 20 leeches weigh about 2 qian, 25 fly larvae are approximately 2.5 qian, 20 peach kernels weigh 2 qian, and rhubarb is 3 qian. \"Jue Shi\" refers to the time after taking the medicine today, which is at least 24 hours; if blood is expelled, no further doses are needed. If blood is expelled, there is no need to continue taking it. One pill is sufficient for each dose. The amount of stagnant blood varies among individuals; while the prescription remains the same, the dosage may differ. Stop taking it once the desired effect is achieved.\n\nAccording to the \"Liu Ju Fang Guang Yi,\" this formula states: \"In my family, we use this formula, taking the four ingredients and grinding them into a powder, then refining with honey into pills.\" Using raw honey will enhance the effect. It also states: \"If it forms into lumps, it is suitable for chronic patients; although they may have taken medicine regularly, it is still difficult to achieve results.\"",

          "english_text": "In the case of blood's original color, the reason is due to insufficient fluids; at this time, eating water pears is best. \"When Yang is excessive, it leads to nosebleeds.\" Yang energy rises, and if the patient experiences nosebleeds, the heat within the blood will disperse, leading to improvement. If the patient has \"Yin deficiency with difficulty urinating,\" it is because the body lacks fluids. \"When both Yin and Yang are exhausted, the body becomes dry.\" If the patient suffers from both Yin and Yang deficiency, the body will become dry and emaciated. However, why does sweating occur only on the head? The body may not sweat at all, yet the head is sweating profusely; this phenomenon is referred to in TCM as \"floating Yang.\" Floating Yang relates to the immune system and the function of the gastrointestinal tract, as well as the heat within the gastrointestinal system. Under normal circumstances, Yin and Yang intersect. Why can Yang heat remain in the middle jiao without dispersing? This is because the body possesses both Yin and Yang, as well as fluids, existing in a certain ratio, allowing it to remain in the middle jiao. If one day the fluids decrease, the reason for the fluid deficiency may be due to being attacked or scorched by fire. When fluids are insufficient, the Yang heat in the stomach rushes to the head, causing sweating. In herbal medicine, the best way to bring down floating Yang is through the use of oyster shells, which can gather floating Yang. According to the classic texts, a person with a \"steamer head\" can only serve as a school official and cannot become a military officer, as this person is too impatient. \n\nIn another scenario, Yangming heat can also easily cause sweating on the head, which is different from the previous case where only head sweating occurs due to both Yin and Yang being deficient. \"Abdominal fullness\" indicates that the stool inside has become dry. \"Slight wheezing, dry mouth, and sore throat\" indicate that the throat has become ulcerated. \"Or no bowel movement; if prolonged, it leads to delirium, and in severe cases, to hiccups.\" When hiccups occur, it signifies that the stomach Qi is exhausted, which is very dangerous. If this continues, \"the hands and feet become restless, fiddling with clothes and touching the bed. If there is slight urination...\"",

If there is also a situation of \"hands and feet restless, fidgeting with clothes and touching the bed,\" it means that the stool is completely dry in the intestines. If urination is still smooth, it indicates that the original yang is still present, as urination is a manifestation of qi transformation, suggesting that the body fluids are still available. However, if urination has ceased, it is indeed very dangerous.\n\nFor example, in the case of a child with a cold presenting with a Ma Huang Decoction pattern, if one dose causes excessive sweating and the fever subsides, it may shift to a Bai Hu Decoction pattern. If misdiagnosed and treated with Da Qing Long Decoction while the child continues to sweat, it turns out to be a Tai Yang exterior syndrome, which can quickly transform into a Yang Ming dryness syndrome. The act of fidgeting and touching the bed indicates that the body fluids are depleted. In the case of Yang Ming dryness-heat syndrome, it is difficult to accurately palpate the pulse of a child, as their pulse is typically rapid even when normal. If the abdomen is tender to touch, it indicates that the stool is obstructed inside. Should one consider Da Cheng Qi Decoction or Bai Hu Decoction for Yang Ming syndrome? Ultimately, due to the tenderness, Da Cheng Qi Decoction was used, and upon administration, the fever subsided. Additionally, this child has had jaundice since a young age, with poor bowel movements, frequently experiencing Yang Ming dryness-heat, often feeling thirsty, and suffering from constipation, with slow cognitive responses. A single attack with Da Cheng Qi Decoction resolved the issues.\n\nXun Zhai stated: \"This section should use medicine according to the pattern. For 'jaundice disease,' use Yin Chen Hao Decoction; for abdominal fullness with shortness of breath, delirium, and constipation, use Cheng Qi Decoction. The unique symptom of restlessness and fidgeting is a phenomenon of near-neural exhaustion, and the method is not to treat it.\" This phenomenon can be addressed with Da Cheng Qi Decoction. If the Bai Hu Decoction pattern causes strong fever, using Xi Jiao Di Huang Decoction may be beneficial, but if there is constipation, it will not improve.",

In cases of \"cold damage,\" with a floating pulse, if the physician uses fire to forcefully expel it, and there is \"loss of yang,\" the patient will inevitably be in a state of shock and agitation, unable to lie down or rest. In such cases, the prescription \"Gui Zhi Decoction minus Shao Yao, plus Shu Qi, Long Gu, and Mu Li to Rescue Reversal Decoction\" is indicated.\n\nThe primary formula for internal treatment of burns in traditional Chinese medicine is \"Gui Zhi Decoction minus Shao Yao, plus Shu Qi, Long Gu, and Mu Li to Rescue Reversal Decoction.\" We can prepare this decoction at the scene of a fire to help those affected. When burns occur, the skin can be damaged in patches, sometimes even cracking open, leading to large, painful blisters. Patients may become agitated and delirious due to the shock of the fire, as bodily fluids rush to the surface of the skin, causing pain and preventing sleep, leading to restlessness and irritability. Zhang Zhongjing wrote about \"Rescue Reversal\" for emergency situations; when the pulse is floating, it indicates that the illness is on the surface. When fire ignites, fluids rush to the skin's surface without transforming into sweat, resulting in a significant amount of fluid accumulating there. When one takes a dose of \"Gui Zhi Decoction minus Shao Yao, plus Shu Qi, Long Gu, and Mu Li to Rescue Reversal Decoction,\" within about an hour, as the medicine disperses to the skin's surface, the pain will significantly decrease. Since this is a rescue formula, it is crucial to quickly deliver the medicine to the skin's surface. Therefore, Shao Yao, which has astringent properties, is removed from the formula. If Shao Yao were included, the medicinal effect would not reach the skin's surface quickly enough. Once the medicine reaches the skin's surface, Shu Qi is added; Shu Qi, also known as Changshan Miao, helps to resolve phlegm. Normally, bodily fluids are contained within the gastrointestinal tract, but when exposed to intense heat, some of these fluids rush to the skin's surface, leading to the rapid formation of blisters due to the speed of the reaction.",

Once pathogenic factors enter the chest, the movement of water within the chest will not function normally, and a significant amount of energy will be expended to resist this. Consequently, it naturally becomes obstructed, leading to symptoms such as nausea and vomiting in the patient. Therefore, whenever a patient exhibits vomiting, one should immediately consider the Shaoyang. Why does vomiting occur? When the water pathways are not functioning properly, the stomach cannot absorb nutrients effectively, preventing them from entering the Sanjiao and the internal organs. As stated in the \"Neijing\": \"The Sanjiao is where the water pathways emerge, it is the official of drainage.\" Thus, the Sanjiao serves as the transport system. In this condition, old food remains undigested because the Sanjiao is afflicted by pathogenic factors, new blood cannot be generated, and newly ingested food is not processed, leading to stagnation in the gastrointestinal tract, which results in nausea. These symptoms are all principal manifestations of Shaoyang in the Sanjiao.\n\n#SECTION\n\n278. \"Shaoyang Wind,\" characterized by the inability to hear with both ears, red eyes, and fullness and agitation in the chest, should not be treated with vomiting or purging; doing so will lead to palpitations and agitation.\n\nIf it is Shaoyang, it also has manifestations of Taiyang. Initially, when one contracts a wind invasion, it presents as a Taiyang condition. During a Taiyang illness, the Yang Qi in the gastrointestinal tract, which represents the immune system and the ability to consolidate the exterior, expends some energy to resist the exterior pathogenic factors, leading to sweating. The fluids necessary to combat the exterior pathogens become insufficient. Under these conditions, the original illness has not resolved, and it progresses into the Shaoyang stage, indicating that the fluids have already been damaged. When the fluids in the gastrointestinal tract are expelled to resist the exterior pathogens during the Taiyang condition, the illness transitions into Shaoyang because it could not withstand the attack. Therefore, the use of sweating methods is intended to strengthen the immune system in the context of insufficient fluids.",

In cases of fullness in the upper jiao, it is generally treated with vomiting methods.

Inducing vomiting excessively can harm the qi, which refers to damaging the source of body fluids, as a significant amount of mucus and food will be expelled. \n\nUsing purgatives can harm the blood, as blood is generated from the digestive process in the small intestine.

If astringent agents are taken and the diarrhea does not stop, one should promote urination to help regulate the qi.\n\nClinically, moxibustion can also be applied to points such as 'Da Chang Shu,' 'Yao Shu,' 'Zhong Ji,' 'Guan Yuan,' 'Shui Dao,' and 'Shui Fen.'\n\nChi Shi Zhi Yu Yu Liang Decoction:\nOne pound of crushed Chi Shi Zhi, one pound of crushed Yu Yu Liang. \nCombine these two ingredients with six liters of water, boil down to two liters, strain, and divide into three warm doses.\n\nIn cases of 'Shang Han' (Cold Damage) after eight or nine days, following vomiting and diarrhea, if there is restlessness, hardness below the heart, pain below the ribs, qi rising to the throat, dizziness, and a return of sweating, the pulse is very weak, and if the meridians are reactive, it may develop into 'wei' (atrophy).\n\nAfter eight or nine days of 'Shang Han,' if the patient has experienced vomiting and diarrhea, and after excessive vomiting, the food in the stomach and intestines is depleted. Therefore, excessive vomiting can lead to blood loss, as the source of nourishment is gone, resulting in the patient feeling restless. This restlessness arises because the heart governs blood, and with insufficient blood, the stomach becomes empty, leading to a lack of fluids in the stomach. Consequently, the patient may feel 'hardness below the heart,' indicating that the stomach feels hard; if pressure on the stomach reveals a hard mass, it suggests retained food, while if it feels soft and pliable, it indicates that there is nothing inside, and the stomach wall has adhered together. 'Pain below the ribs, qi rising to the throat' occurs because the vomiting and diarrhea have caused damage; the stomach qi, which should descend, is instead rising.\"",

When food enters the stomach, it is ground up and then moves into the small intestine and subsequently into the large intestine; the food is supposed to move downward, as the stomach's peristaltic movement is directed downward. However, due to excessive vomiting, the stomach qi rises, and with nothing in the stomach, the qi surges up to the throat, causing the patient to feel a constant upward pressure towards the throat. The patient experiences dizziness and lightheadedness due to insufficient blood supply, leading to hypoxia. If sweating is induced in this condition, the water content in the blood decreases further, causing more harm. When the water content in the blood is insufficient, the patient may experience high fever, resulting in a weak pulse.

Xuanfu Hua and Dai Zhe Shi are TCM herbs used to eliminate heat and phlegm. Sweating, vomiting, and purging have not removed the phlegm, which remains stuck in the middle. This \"reversed qi\" differs from the \"reversed qi\" in Gan Cao Xie Xin Decoction, which is purely due to deficiency. Xuanfu Dai Zhe Shi Decoction contains phlegm and fluid, using Xuanfu Hua to soften and dissolve the hardened phlegm, and Dai Zhe Shi to descend the rebellious qi and stop the reversed qi. \n\nXuanfu Dai Zhe Shi Decoction is used for patients who often feel nausea and have phlegm that cannot be expelled, along with a deficiency in the stomach. The symptoms of acid reflux and heartburn can often be resolved with just one dose of Xuanfu Dai Zhe Shi Decoction. The cause is often excessive consumption of refined sugars in sweet foods, so after prescribing the decoction, it is also necessary to advise the patient to completely avoid sweets made from refined sugars.\n\nAccording to \"Canying Guan Zhiliao Zahua\": \"Zhou Yangjun said: 'For treating nausea and reversed qi that does not descend, this has miraculous effects.' This refers to cases where 'Sheng Jiang Xie Xin Decoction' has been used but the nausea persists, indicating a reversal of deficient qi, and this formula should be used to suppress it.\" Xuanfu Dai Zhe Shi Decoction is used in classical formulas to suppress rebellious qi, especially when the feeling of nausea and reversed qi is strong. Relying solely on Ban Xia (Pinellia) cannot stop the vomiting; it is necessary to use Xuanfu Hua and Dai Zhe Shi. Ban Xia is most effective for \"water vomiting,\" but its power is insufficient for \"phlegm vomiting,\" so Xuanfu Hua and Dai Zhe Shi must be used at this time.\n\nDifferentiation of \"Jie Xiong\" (Chest Bind) syndrome, \"Pi\" syndrome, and similar syndromes: \n\"Cold Excess Jie Xiong\" refers to \"pus in the chest\" or \"lung abscess,\" and \"San Wu Xiao Bai San\" can eliminate pus and toxins. \"Jie Xiong syndrome\"",

For hysteria, Western medicine still does not have effective medications to treat this condition of hidden dryness.\n\nWhen a woman vomits saliva, if the physician purges it, there will be a feeling of fullness in the heart area. The first step is to treat the vomiting of saliva, for which Xiao Qing Long Tang (Minor Blue Dragon Decoction) is the main prescription. Once the saliva stops, then the treatment for the feeling of fullness can be addressed, for which Xie Xin Tang (Drain the Heart Decoction) is the main prescription.\n\nRegarding \"a woman vomiting saliva,\" the \"Nei Jing\" states: \"Saliva is vomited from the mouth when there is cold in the upper jiao.\" When a patient has cold in the upper jiao, they will vomit saliva; at this time, warming herbs should be used, such as Ma Xing Gan Shi Tang (Ephedra, Apricot Kernel, Licorice, and Gypsum Decoction) or Da Jian Zhong Tang (Major Construct the Middle Decoction), employing warming and dispersing methods. However, if a doctor mistakenly purges the patient, it can lead to a feeling of fullness in the heart area, as the cold descends and settles below the stomach.

Over time, this can lead to emaciation, with a weak pulse and a predominance of coldness. The thirty-six diseases manifest in countless variations; one must carefully examine the pulse for yin and yang, deficiency and excess, and tightness of the pulse.

Although the diseases may appear similar, the pulses differ in origin; one must discern and record these differences, lest one be mistaken.\n\nThis section is for your reference. \"Women's diseases\" generally arise from three causes: one is \"deficiency\" in the body, another is \"accumulated cold,\" as young women often enjoy eating ice, which is detrimental since their bodies tend to be more deficient and heat-prone. The third cause is \"stagnation of qi,\" where unresolved emotional issues lead to daily anger without understanding the reasons behind it. \"When the menstrual flow is obstructed for years,\" this can result in the cessation of menstruation for one or two years, leading to \"cold blood accumulating at the uterine orifice,\" with conditions such as blood stasis and cold accumulation forming in the uterus. In severe cases, the cold can harm the meridians. If the \"stagnation is located above,\" and the cold blood is concentrated near the liver area, the patient may experience \"vomiting\" and \"salivation.\" Over time, this can develop into \"chronic pulmonary atrophy.\" Since the liver is partially above and partially below the diaphragm, its channels directly connect to the entire area surrounding the lungs, leading to sensations of chest fullness and discomfort, resulting in \"physical deterioration,\" with the patient becoming increasingly emaciated. \n\n\"If there is a mass in the middle burner, causing cold hernias around the navel, or pain in both sides,\" if the obstruction is located in the middle jiao, which includes the liver, gallbladder, spleen, and stomach, it can lead to pain around the navel and abdominal pain or pain below the ribs. \"If it connects with the organs, or if there is heat accumulation, pain will manifest at the lower abdomen.\" If it is in contact with the uterus or obstructing the Ren meridian...",

          "english_text": "Why does menstruation stop and lead to this condition? Zhang Zhongjing stated that this illness is referred to as \"leucorrhea.\" For women's miscellaneous diseases, we have a unified term called \"leucorrhea.\" The reason for this is \"previous incomplete childbirth.\" Women may have experienced a miscarriage in their youth, resulting in \"stagnant blood remaining in the lower abdomen.\" Some women, after giving birth, may not have had their uterus completely cleared, leaving stagnant blood inside, which leads to the current symptoms of dryness in the lips and mouth. At this time, \"Wen Jing Tang\" (Warm the Meridian Decoction) should be used for treatment. This is because when women experience amenorrhea, the uterus will atrophy, and using large doses of medicine to attack the condition is incorrect. When the uterus is atrophying, we often use Wen Jing Tang, as there is stagnant blood in the lower abdomen. Wen Jing Tang is specifically used for when the uterus is deficient and cold. Therefore, in addition to being applicable during menopause, it can also be used for irregular menstruation or when there is stagnant blood in the uterus that cannot be removed, as well as in cases of female infertility.\n\nWen Jing Tang has historically been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine as a prescription for seeking conception. Thus, one can note beside Wen Jing Tang \"long-term blood cold,\" indicating that over the years, cold blood has accumulated at the entrance of the uterus and within the uterus itself. \"Cold\" refers to a lack of warmth, indicating a state of hypoxia, where blood stagnates and clots accumulate in the uterus, which is why Wen Jing Tang is also a prescription for seeking conception. \n\nAs for Wu Zhu Yu (Evodia rutaecarpa), Zhang Zhongjing selected it because it enters the liver channel, which can invigorate liver blood and facilitate its flow to the uterus. Dang Gui (Angelica sinensis), Chuan Xiong (Ligusticum chuanxiong), and Shao Yao (Paeonia lactiflora) are all blood tonics that can increase blood volume. Ren Shen (Ginseng), Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig), along with the later additions of Sheng Jiang (Fresh Ginger) and Gan Cao (Licorice), are all yang-moving herbs that can invigorate yang energy. When yang energy is abundant, blood will also circulate accordingly. These herbs can both generate yang and invigorate blood.",

Ejiao (donkey-hide gelatin) is used for stopping bleeding and replenishing blood, as the patient has experienced blood loss. Danpi (moutan root) is an herb that breaks up blood stasis, particularly because women often have cold blood concentrated in the uterus. If we forcefully attack this condition, the patient's body may become weak and depleted. Therefore, we must ensure that she has blood stasis or that her uterus is too cold to conceive before using it.

Sometimes menstruation may be excessive, and at other times it may be delayed; Warming the Channels Decoction can be used to treat these conditions. It can also assist in conception for those who have been infertile for many years, making Warming the Channels Decoction a very useful formula.\n\nFor leukorrhea, if menstruation is not smooth, with fullness and pain in the lower abdomen, and if menstruation is absent for a month, the prescription is Tu Guo Gen San (Earth Gourd Root Powder).\n\nTu Guo Gen San formula:\nTu Guo Gen (Earth Gourd Root), Shao Yao (Peony), Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig), and Chan Chong (Silkworm) each three parts.\n\nThe four ingredients should be ground into a powder, and taken with a small spoonful of wine, three times a day. \n\nWhen discussing leukorrhea, it pertains to menstrual disorders.

If menstruation occurs in one month and then is absent the next, returning in the third month, with a month of amenorrhea in between, we should use Tu Guo Gen San for young women with cold accumulation in the uterus.

If Chan Chong is unavailable, it can be substituted with Tao Ren (Peach Kernel) or Hong Hua (Safflower). Additionally, we may include blood-activating and stasis-resolving herbs like San Ling and E Zhu, which are used in certain prescriptions; these are all medicines that promote menstruation. Generally, if menstruation does not arrive normally, we need to promote menstruation, and this is achieved with Tu Guo Gen San. If you wish to use Wen Jing Tang (Warm the Menses Decoction), the primary symptom of the patient is dry lips and a dry mouth, indicating internal blood deficiency. If the patient does not have blood deficiency, there is no need to use Wen Jing Tang; simply using Tu Guo Gen San to promote menstruation will suffice. Both Wen Jing Tang and Tu Guo Gen San are used to treat blood stasis in the uterus, but the difference is that one is for blood deficiency and the other is for sufficient blood. Wen Jing Tang is used when there is insufficient blood, which causes dryness of the mouth and tongue.\n\nThe pulse at the cun (radial) position is wiry and large; a wiry pulse indicates reduction, a large pulse indicates fullness, a reduced pulse indicates cold, and a hollow pulse indicates deficiency. Cold deficiency interacting with each other is termed \"ge.\" In women, this can lead to postpartum hemorrhage, while in men, it can result in blood loss and loss of essence.\n\nThis has been introduced previously. \n\nFor women experiencing amenorrhea with continuous dark bleeding, Jiao Jiang Tang (Ginger and Gelatin Decoction) is the main treatment.\n\nJiao Jiang Tang formula:\nJiao Ai Tang (Mugwort and Gelatin Decoction) plus dried ginger, as seen in \"Qian Jin Fang\" (Thousand Gold Prescriptions).\n\nWhat is meant by \"amenorrhea\"? It actually refers to blood collapse (excessive bleeding). Please note, \"amenorrhea is blood collapse.\" When a girl experiences blood collapse, it means there is a large amount of bleeding, or it may be continuous dripping. Generally, menstruation lasts for five days, but if it continues for fifteen days without stopping, with continuous dripping, and \"dark and unresolved,\" it indicates that the menstrual blood has turned black, which signifies a lack of oxygen and insufficient yang.

          "english_text": "The prescription specifically introduces how to treat this condition. \n\nThe pulse at the cun (寸) position is string-like and large; if it is string-like, it indicates deficiency, and if it is large, it indicates a hollow pulse. A string-like pulse suggests cold, while a hollow pulse indicates emptiness. The interplay of cold and emptiness is termed \"ge\" (革). In women, this can lead to miscarriage, while in men, it can result in loss of blood and seminal fluid.\n\nWhen palpating the pulse, the fingertips press in the area between the cun and guan (關) positions, where the pulse beats back and forth, alternating from one side to the other. How can we, in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), know that a woman is at risk of miscarriage? Because in a healthy individual, the blood from the heart flows down to the lower jiao (下焦) to nourish the fetus for its growth. The mother consumes food, which enters the stomach, and after digestion by the spleen and stomach, it is passed to the lungs. The lungs, through the chong mai (衝脈), produce part of the milk and another part descends to the uterus, providing nourishment to the fetus. Additionally, blood from the liver also enters the uterus, aiding in the child's growth. Both pathways in TCM are sources of fetal blood.\n\nIf we palpate the pulse of a normal pregnant woman, it will flow continuously from the cun to the chi (尺) position. However, in the case of the patient, the pulse is jumping back and forth on both sides, indicating internal deficiency and insufficient yin blood. When we have insufficient blood, there are two types of pulse conditions: the first is weak and almost imperceptible, indicating imminent death, as the blood flow is about to cease; at this point, the pulse is so small that it cannot even be felt. The second type has some blood remaining, but the patient's vitality is very strong; when you palpate the pulse, it feels more urgent because the internal organs are competing for blood, causing the pulse to run on both sides.\n\nWhen a pregnant woman is weak, the blood in the uterus will be insufficient. This blood is originally meant to nourish the fetus for its growth, but if it suddenly runs out, it can lead to miscarriage and continuous bleeding. A menstrual cycle that should occur once a month may instead happen four times.",

A woman who is supposed to have her menstrual period once a month may experience it four or five times instead. Sometimes it lasts for three days and then stops, only to return shortly after, creating a continuous cycle.\n\nWhen a man encounters this type of pulse, it indicates \"loss of blood and essence,\" because a man's essence and blood share the same origin, just as a man's sweat and blood do. A man's essence is similar to a woman's breast milk, which is white. A woman's breast milk is transformed from nutrients by the heat of the heart before descending to the uterus to become blood. A man's essence is formed by the heat of the small intestine vaporizing nutrients, and both are white in color. The treatment for postpartum bleeding and miscarriage will be introduced later. How should a man with loss of blood and essence be treated? One might use Gui Zhi Long Gu Mu Li Tang (Cinnamon Twig, Dragon Bone, and Oyster Decoction), but this only prevents the loss of essence. If the goal is to enhance vitality, Gui Zhi Long Gu Mu Li Tang is not as effective; we need to rely on formulas like Tian Xiong San (Heavenly Hero Powder) and similar remedies.\n\nFor individuals who have lost blood, if they are induced to sweat, they may experience \"cold shivering and trembling.\" As I mentioned earlier, sweat and blood share the same origin in the human body. Therefore, individuals with conditions such as epistaxis, blood loss, or sores should not be induced to sweat. Additionally, if a patient has numerous sores on their body, you should also refrain from inducing sweating.\n\nA patient may present with fullness in the chest, dry lips, a bluish tongue, and a dry mouth, desiring to rinse with water but not wanting to swallow. There is no presence of cold or heat, the pulse is weak and large, and it comes late. The abdomen is not distended, and the patient reports a feeling of fullness, indicating the presence of stagnant blood.\n\nThe phrase \"patient with fullness in the chest and dry lips\" marks the beginning of our discussion on the diagnostic principles of stagnant blood. How can we determine if there is stagnant blood in a patient's body? There are many causes of stagnant blood; some individuals may have retained lochia after childbirth, while others may have internal injuries or trauma from falls.",

          "english_text": "Is there blood stasis in the body? There are many reasons for blood stasis. For some individuals, it may be due to retained lochia after childbirth that has not been completely expelled. For others, it may result from internal injuries or trauma, and various accidents can also lead to blood stasis within the body. There are several symptoms that can help us in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnose whether a patient has blood stasis. \n\nThe first symptom is \"chest fullness,\" where the patient feels a sensation of fullness in the chest. The second symptom is \"dry and shriveled lips,\" where the lips appear dry and contracted. Why is this the case? I will explain shortly, but first, let’s note a few important symptoms. The second symptom is \"blue tongue and dry mouth,\" indicating dryness in the mouth and a bluish color of the tongue. \n\nIn TCM, the concept is that \"the heart governs blood.\" Therefore, when there is blood stasis, the force of blood returning to the heart is insufficient, leading to the sensation of chest fullness. For instance, when we use Gui Zhi Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction), if we encounter a patient with chest fullness, we need to remove Bai Shao (White Peony Root) because individuals with heart issues will experience chest fullness. \n\nAdditionally, the spleen governs transportation and transformation; the spleen is associated with the earth element and is yellow in color. The spleen plays a crucial role in the transportation of nutrients within the body. During the process of blood production, if there is blood stasis obstructing the body, this stasis may be located in the stomach or intestines, regardless of its specific location. The presence of blood stasis indicates a problem with blood circulation, which prevents normal blood from being transported to the limbs. \n\nMoreover, the spleen opens to the lips, so at this time, we can observe that the patient's mouth appears drier and more withered, lacking moisture. The tongue may show a bluish color, but this bluish hue is not uniform across the entire tongue; rather, it is observed on both sides of the tongue body. This is something I have seen frequently in clinical practice. Generally, when encountering individuals with internal injuries, we can observe their tongue when they extend it.",

This criterion essentially discusses how we differentiate whether a patient is pregnant or if there is a tumor in the uterus. \"Zheng\" refers to blood clots or similar tumors, which may include stagnant blood clots or tumors that have not been expelled. During pregnancy, menstruation should normally cease, which is expected. For example, if menstruation is due on the 5th of this month but does not occur, how do we determine whether she is pregnant or has a pathological condition? We must first inquire about her menstrual history over the past three months. If her menstruation was very regular during those three months, it is possible that she is pregnant. If her menstruation was irregular during the previous three months, this does not necessarily indicate pregnancy. This is the first key point considered by Zhang Zhongjing.\n\nIf it is confirmed that she is pregnant, and by the third month, she experiences continuous bleeding, we should suspect the presence of a pathological condition. \"Women may have pathological conditions.\" If a pregnant woman already has stagnant blood or a pathological condition in the uterus, it is common for her to experience continuous bleeding by the third month of pregnancy. \"Fetal movement at the navel\" actually does not refer to true fetal movement; rather, it indicates that due to the presence of stagnant blood, there may be palpitations that feel like movement at the navel. This is not genuine fetal movement but rather a sign that there are pathological masses obstructing the growth of the fetus. In summary, if menstruation was very regular in the first three months of pregnancy, and by the third month there is continuous bleeding with bright red blood, it suggests a pathological condition rather than a normal pregnancy.",

Simply put, if menstruation is normal during the first three months of pregnancy, but in the third month after conception there is continuous bleeding with bright red blood, it indicates that the woman is pregnant but is at risk of miscarriage, which is not caused by any pathological condition. If menstruation was already abnormal during the first three months and then there is a continuous absence of menstruation for three months, at this point it is unclear whether she has a pathological condition or is pregnant. If, after the third month, she experiences continuous dark bleeding, it indicates that there is a pathological condition in the uterus, not a pregnancy. The practitioner wants to emphasize that it is essential to confirm that the woman is not pregnant before prescribing medication; misdiagnosis could lead to a pregnant woman taking Gui Zhi Fu Ling Wan, which could result in miscarriage. \n\nAs for the continuous bleeding, why does her menstruation continue to flow? It is because \"the pathology has not been resolved, hence the ongoing symptoms.\" Currently, in clinical practice, we find that Gui Zhi Fu Ling Wan is particularly effective for conditions such as uterine fibroids or ovarian tumors.

Originally, her menstrual cycle was very regular, but after she started taking Gui Zhi Fu Ling Wan, her menstruation continued without stopping. However, she felt great, did not become weak, and her abdomen began to shrink, all from just taking Gui Zhi Fu Ling Wan without adding any other special prescriptions. Therefore, for uterine fibroids, ovarian tumors, and other abdominal tumors in women, this formula can be used, and surgery should be avoided for now. Sometimes, after surgery, if bleeding does not stop, Western medicine only has the option of removing the entire uterus or the ovaries, which would prevent future pregnancies, leading to more complications, and sometimes even a loss of libido.\n\nSince the condition is caused by blood stasis, Zhang Zhongjing employed both methods of breaking the stasis and breaking the blood. The functions of Dan Pi (Moutan Cortex) and Tao Ren (Peach Kernel) are to invigorate blood circulation and resolve stasis. Traditional Chinese Medicine theory posits that a man's Jing Gong (essence palace) and a woman's uterus are merely gaps within the lower jiao's oil network, rather than being classified as an organ or a viscera. This is considered an issue within the oil network of the three jiao, which is why Fu Ling (Poria) is included. Fu Ling itself enters the three jiao and can facilitate the flow within the oil network. Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig) is used because it can open and regulate the Chong Mai (Penetrating Vessel), allowing the blood from the upper jiao to descend. When the blood from the upper jiao descends, Fu Ling transports this new blood into the uterus, while Dan Pi and Tao Ren work to break up the old stagnant blood, effectively clearing the blood clots within the uterine fibroids. During this process, there may be concerns about abdominal cramping; at this time...",

          "english_text": "The spleen is unable to transform and transport, and the liver does not store blood, leading to blood leakage; thus, this condition is classified as a deficiency of both the liver and spleen. Sometimes this occurs due to excessive alcohol consumption, heavy thinking, high work pressure, or feelings of loneliness at home, all of which can contribute to the deficiency of both the liver and spleen. As a result, many young women may experience abnormal bleeding. Those who have studied the pulse of abnormal bleeding will recognize that the pulse is bounding on both sides in the area below the cun pulse and above the guan pulse, indicating that menstruation is flowing excessively.\n\nThe second condition is \"post-abortion bleeding that does not cease.\" Post-abortion refers to miscarriage. After a patient has a miscarriage, menstruation may not stop and continues indefinitely. The third condition is \"bleeding during pregnancy,\" where some individuals experience bleeding during pregnancy or continue to bleed after giving birth. At this time, the patient's complexion is dark, indicating significant blood loss. Zhang Zhongjing stated: \"All these phenomena can be treated with Jiao Ai Decoction.\" Jiao Ai Decoction is a very effective formula. In Jiao Ai Decoction, there is dried rehmannia, which is known for its blood-nourishing properties. Our Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (Six-Ingredient Rehmannia Pill) is primarily used for the kidneys; when the kidneys are strengthened, they can replenish the liver's blood. Therefore, dried rehmannia is actually used to nourish the liver and replenish blood. Chuanxiong can invigorate blood circulation, while Ejiao can stop bleeding. Mugwort leaves can ensure the smooth flow of the meridians, which is why we use mugwort for moxibustion. Angelica can nourish blood, and peony can both restrain bleeding and alleviate abdominal pain. The most important components of Jiao Ai Decoction are Ejiao and mugwort leaves, which is why it is named \"Jiao Ai Decoction,\" with Ejiao specifically used to stop bleeding. \n\nNow you know that when there is gastric bleeding, we use cypress leaves, which are a plant-based gelatin to stop the bleeding. If there is uterine bleeding or bleeding from other areas, we...",

          "english_text": "Now the family understands that when there is gastric bleeding, we should use cypress leaves, which are a plant-based gelatin to stop the bleeding. If it is uterine bleeding or bleeding from other areas, we need to use donkey-hide gelatin (Ejiao) to stop the bleeding. For example, when a patient is weak, we prescribe a nourishing formula: we can use one or two taels of dried rehmannia, five qian of ligusticum wallichii, three qian of Ejiao, three qian of licorice, and three qian each of mugwort and angelica, then four qian of peony. When cooking, we can add six bowls of water, then add one and a half or two bowls of rice wine and cook together until it reduces to two bowls, then drink it. These herbs need to be cooked with wine; however, it is also fine if you do not add wine. While decocting the medicine, we can assist the patient with acupuncture, using points that can stop bleeding and leakage, such as Yinbai on the spleen channel and Dadu on the liver channel to treat both liver and spleen deficiency. Additionally, we can needle Sanyinjiao and Xuehai. After needling Xuehai, the patient's abdominal pain will subside, and Sanyinjiao can help invigorate the qi and blood of the liver and spleen. The points Dadu and Yinbai themselves can also stop bleeding, and in this situation, using acupuncture in combination will yield faster results. After needling, while the patient's family is still decocting the medicine, the patient's bleeding will have already stopped; the effect is very quick, unless you needle the wrong point.\n\nFor women who are pregnant and experience abdominal cramping, we use the Danggui Shaoyao San.\n\nDanggui Shaoyao San formula:\nDanggui and Chuanxiong each 3 taels, Peony 1 pound, Poria and Bai Zhu each 4 taels, and Ze Xie ½ pound.\n\nMix these six ingredients, grind into a powder, and take with wine three times a day.\n\nDanggui Shaoyao San is a prescription used for women after becoming pregnant when excessive water qi leads to insufficient blood.

If a woman experiences both Qi and blood deficiency during the postpartum period and then develops heat-related diarrhea, in addition to using Bai Tou Weng Decoction, E Jiao and Gan Cao should be added. Gan Cao is used to tonify the middle, while E Jiao can nourish the blood. This is applicable when the body is in a deficient state and experiences heat-related issues.

In summary, when encountering foul-smelling stools, persistent diarrhea, and a weak body, Bai Tou Weng combined with Gan Cao and E Jiao Decoction should be used.\n\nIn the section on women's miscellaneous diseases and pulse diagnosis, it states: \"If a woman has a stroke for seven or eight days, followed by intermittent chills and fever, and her menstrual flow is suddenly interrupted, this indicates that heat has entered the blood chamber, causing blood stasis, which results in a condition resembling malaria, with intermittent episodes. Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is indicated.\" \n\nThe phrase \"a woman with a stroke for seven or eight days\" refers to a typical stroke that is unrelated to pregnancy.

As I mentioned previously, when a woman has her menstrual period, it is due to the flow of milk descending along the Chong and Ren meridians into the uterus, which then becomes menstrual blood. When a woman catches a cold coinciding with her menstrual period, the virus can enter the uterus along with the milk. Since the genital area is primarily governed by the liver meridian, the illness can then progress from the uterus to the liver, which is situated above the diaphragm. Consequently, the patient may experience fullness and discomfort in the chest and sides, and the condition can develop rapidly. At this point, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction may no longer be effective; instead, one should needle the Qimen point. Historically, many practitioners of classical formulas did not utilize acupuncture. This section indicates that if the Taiyang syndrome has already entered the uterus, Zhang Zhongjing states that using Xiao Chai Hu Decoction at this stage is too late, as it is \"heat entering the blood chamber.\" If it is too late for that, we can perform acupuncture at Qimen. If there are still alternating cold and heat symptoms, \"like a malarial condition,\" we can continue using Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. From this, it can be understood that Zhang Zhongjing considered the uterus to belong to the Sanjiao system.\n\nFor women with cold damage presenting with fever, if menstruation coincides, during the day they may appear clear-headed, but by evening they may exhibit delirium, as if seeing ghosts. This indicates \"heat entering the blood chamber.\" For treatment, one must avoid disturbing the stomach qi and the upper two Jiao, and recovery will occur naturally. \n\n\"When a woman has cold damage with fever, menstruation coinciding, and during the day she is clear-headed but at dusk begins to exhibit 'ghost-like' symptoms,\" this indicates \"heat entering the blood chamber.\" For treatment, methods such as inducing vomiting, sweating, or purging are inappropriate; instead, a harmonizing approach is correct, such as using Xiao Chai Hu Decoction or allowing the patient to recover on their own.\n\nIn cases of women experiencing wind stroke, with fever and chills, coinciding menstruation, lasting seven to eight days, once the heat subsides, the pulse becomes slow, and the body feels cool and harmonious.",

          "english_text": "Why does amenorrhea manifest in this way? Zhang Zhongjing stated that this condition is referred to as \"leukorrhea.\" For women's miscellaneous diseases, we have a unified term called \"leukorrhea.\" The reason for this is \"previous incomplete childbirth.\" A woman may have experienced a miscarriage in her youth, leading to \"stagnation of blood in the lower abdomen.\" Some women may have retained blood in the uterus after childbirth, resulting in current symptoms such as dryness of the lips and mouth. In such cases, \"Wen Jing Tang\" (Warm the Meridian Decoction) should be used for treatment. This is because when women experience amenorrhea, the uterus tends to atrophy, and using large doses of medication to attack the condition is inappropriate. When the uterus is atrophied, we often use Wen Jing Tang, as there is stagnation of blood in the lower abdomen. Wen Jing Tang is specifically used for conditions of cold deficiency in the uterus, so it can be applied not only during menopause but also for irregular menstruation or when there is retained blood in the uterus that cannot be expelled. It is also applicable for women experiencing infertility.\n\nWen Jing Tang has historically been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine as a prescription for seeking conception, so one can note \"long-term blood cold\" next to it, indicating that over the years, cold blood has accumulated at the entrance of the uterus and within the uterus itself. \"Cold\" refers to a lack of warmth, indicating hypoxia and stagnation, which is caused by blood clots accumulating in the uterus. Therefore, Wen Jing Tang is also a prescription for fertility. \n\nAs for Wu Zhu Yu (Evodia rutaecarpa), Zhang Zhongjing selected it because it enters the liver channel, which can invigorate liver blood and facilitate its flow to the uterus. Dang Gui (Angelica sinensis), Chuan Xiong (Ligusticum chuanxiong), and Shao Yao (Paeonia lactiflora) are all blood tonics that can increase blood volume. Ren Shen (Ginseng), Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig), along with the later additions of Sheng Jiang (Fresh Ginger) and Gan Cao (Licorice), are all yang-moving herbs that can invigorate yang energy. When yang energy is abundant, blood will also circulate, making these herbs effective for both generating yang and invigorating blood.",

          "english_text": "Individuals with fluid deficiency often drink a lot of water but cannot quench their thirst, continuously consuming more. This indicates that their gastrointestinal fluids are inherently insufficient, as previously mentioned regarding the deficiency of stomach fluids. Therefore, if a formula like Xiao Chai Hu Tang is prescribed to resolve the issue, administering a large dose of Xiao Chai Hu Tang may cause the patient to sweat. In such cases, the first step is to needle the \"Dazhui\" point to release the heat of the Taiyang. By bleeding at the \"Dazhui\" point, the heat of the Taiyang will dissipate, as the three Yang channels converge there. \n\nWhy needle \"Fei Shu\"? This is because of the stiffness and pain in the head and neck, which occurs when the lung qi cannot disperse, preventing the exterior heat from dissipating. At this time, the heat from the chest Yang rises, causing headaches. Needling \"Fei Shu\" helps to release the exterior. \n\nWhy needle \"Gan Shu\"? This is because the liver is swollen. It is essential to replenish the stomach's fluids when they are insufficient. If the fluids are lacking, the blood will become too hot, and there will not be enough water in the blood. Consequently, the liver may swell, as the liver is the final organ that stores blood. The heart generates blood, and the liver stores it; thus, when the liver swells, it can press against the stomach, causing hardness in that area. At this point, needling \"Gan Shu\" helps to release the heat from the blood, allowing the blood within the liver to flow out. Therefore, this condition is not a true Shaoyang syndrome.\n\nWhen a patient suffers from fluid damage, it can be observed. Thus, when administering a sweating remedy, it is crucial to first examine the patient's lips. If the lips are dry, sweating should not be induced, as it may lead to delirium. Why does sweating cause delirium? Generally, when a patient has a strong fever, the brain's nerves may not function normally, leading to incoherent speech. \"Pulse is wiry, and for five to six days, delirium does not cease; one should needle 'Qimen',\" indicating that the liver is swollen.",

For example, there was a patient whose entire mouth was cracked and dry, and who had acne on the face. The prescription included three qian of Fuzi (Aconite), one piece of raw Fuzi, and three qian of dried ginger, taken over three doses. This patient could not quench their thirst even when drinking water, due to a condition of vacuity heat. After taking such hot medicine, their thirst diminished.

After administering the medicine, there would be a significant bowel movement, with dampness expelled through the stool.\n\n158.

Normally, the blood produced from the stomach's absorption of nutrients provides resistance, which is contained within the blood. Once the exterior pathogen invades, the resistance moves to the surface to combat it. At this time, menstruation occurs, causing the blood to descend, and the heat follows downward as well. This pathogenic heat then enters the uterus and liver. The term \"blood chamber\" has been debated; some say it refers to the uterus, while others say it refers to the liver. In fact, both are considered blood chambers, and Zhang Zhongjing did not differentiate between them. \"Fullness in the chest and hypochondrium\" is due to the lymphatic system being associated with the Sanjiao (Triple Burner), where the uterus is considered the lower burner and the chest and hypochondrium are considered the middle burner. \"Resembling stagnation of the chest\" indicates that it appears like chest stagnation. \"If there is delirium,\" it signifies that the patient's blood...",

This is due to heat entering the blood chamber, which may involve inflammation in the uterus or hepatitis. \"One should puncture the 'Qi Men' point to drain the heat according to its manifestation.\" The Qi Men point can release heat from the liver and gallbladder; Zhang Zhongjing was the only one who recognized this acupuncture point.\n\nThe \"blood chamber\" refers to the liver, which is the site of the hepatic portal vein where the blood is most abundant and the heat is highest, hence it is called the \"blood chamber.\" Wu's \"Treatise on Epidemics\" states: \"The 'blood chamber' is also known as the 'blood sea,' which corresponds to the Chong and Ren meridians. The classic texts refer to it as the 'uterus' because incoherent speech often occurs during menstruation or when menstruation ceases, thus indicating that the 'uterus' is the 'blood chamber.'\"\n\nCase 159: A woman with \"wind stroke\" experiences chills and fever for seven to eight days, with intermittent episodes, and her menstruation has just stopped. This indicates \"heat entering the blood chamber,\" leading to blood stasis, which manifests as symptoms resembling \"malaria,\" with episodes occurring intermittently. \"Xiao Chai Hu Tang\" is the appropriate treatment.\n\nAfter needling the \"Qi Men,\" the subsequent condition aligns with the symptoms of Xiao Chai Hu Tang. The previous case involved a cold followed by menstruation, while this case describes a woman who initially recovered from a cold, but then, just as her menstruation stopped, she caught another cold. This also indicates heat entering the blood chamber, leading to blood stasis. After heat enters the blood chamber, blood circulation is compromised, including the liver's circulation. If filtering viruses enter the bloodstream, and if the blood stagnates there, it will carry many viruses, causing vascular blockage. The liver contains many blood vessels that need to expel blood; when circulation is smooth, the patient experiences fever, while when it is obstructed, the patient feels cold, resulting in alternating chills and fever. \"Thus, it manifests as symptoms resembling malaria, with episodes occurring intermittently.\"",

Boil it with five bowls of water until three bowls remain, and drink the first bowl. If there is no bowel movement afterward, do not worry; \"bowel movement\" refers to passing blood, and it will not harm the child in the abdomen.\n\nThe definition of the formula by Dong Dongweng states: \"For the treatment of blood stasis, there are two types of blood stasis. The first is when there is pain in the lower abdomen and frequent urination; the second is when the abdomen is not distended, yet the person feels fullness. For urgent cases, use decoction; for less urgent cases, use pills.\" If urination is not smooth, it indicates blood stasis in the bladder, which corresponds to the use of Peach Kernel Decoction. Frequent urination corresponds to the use of Didao Decoction. Additionally, if the abdomen feels soft to the touch and the patient feels discomfort in the abdomen, this is also a blood condition. For urgent cases, use decoctions; for less urgent cases, use pills. Generally speaking, if the condition is superficial, the pain will be very urgent; if the condition is deeper, the pain will be less urgent, hence the use of pills. Why use pills? Pills are characterized by their \"gentle and focused medicinal power.\" For \"acute conditions,\" which need to be expelled quickly, decoctions are used, as decoctions are for cleansing. For gastrointestinal issues, powdered medicines are more effective.\n\nThe \"Fang Yu Nao\" states: \"In cases of upper syndrome, those with body deficiency are often afflicted. A person with body deficiency may have blood stasis in the lower abdomen, but it should not be attacked. However, if not attacked, the illness will not resolve. Well said! Chen Ziming modified this formula by removing 'Da Huang' and adding 'Di Huang,' naming it 'Tongjing Wan.' This slight modification effectively balances the attacking and tonifying properties, which is beyond the strategies of Sun Wu.

For example, before it has turned into pus, we have methods for treating it that do not involve pus. The treatment I mentioned is specifically for when pus has formed; how to distinguish if the patient's pus has formed is to observe the symptoms. Therefore, when the patient has a good appetite and can eat normally, but the area around the eyes is dark, and upon palpating the pulse, it is rapid but without exterior heat, it indicates that pus has already formed. I use red beans (赤小豆) a lot; they not only can clear heat but also detoxify. They can eliminate the toxins produced by peritonitis and are a well-known remedy for treating peritonitis. Whenever there is damp-heat toxicity, Zhang Zhongjing would use red beans.\n\nFor Yang toxicity, the symptoms include a red and mottled face like brocade, sore throat, and expectoration of pus and blood. It can be treated in five days, but not after seven days; the main formula is Shengma Biejia Decoction (升麻鱉甲湯). For Yin toxicity, the symptoms include a bluish face, body pain as if beaten, sore throat, and it can also be treated in five days, but not after seven days; the main formula is Shengma Biejia Decoction with the addition of realgar (雄黃) and Sichuan pepper (蜀椒).\n\nThe formula for Shengma Biejia Decoction is as follows:\nOne piece of turtle shell (about the size of a finger, roasted), half a tael of realgar (ground), two taels each of Shengma (升麻), Angelica sinensis (當歸), and licorice (甘草), and one tael of Sichuan pepper, stir-fried to remove moisture.\n\nTake these six ingredients, add four liters of water, boil down to one liter, and take it in one dose.

This type of Yang toxicity is often seen during wars, on battlefields, in prisons, in ship cabins, and in underdeveloped areas. Why does this happen?

Western medicine still does not understand the true cause of this disease, but when they encounter it, the first action is to quickly isolate the patient. When the rash disease manifests, it begins in the abdominal area. If Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) observes that the rash is red, the prognosis is grim—one in ten may survive. If the rash is black, the prognosis is even worse—one in ten may live, indicating that black is the most dangerous. Western medicine recognizes the strong infectiousness of this disease, and there are no Western medications that can treat it. Therefore, when faced with such a situation, all items that the patient has touched are quickly gathered and burned.\n\nIf this infectious disease occurs during wartime, when soldiers in prolonged combat become infected, the contagion spreads rapidly.

Yang toxin is primarily characterized by symptoms such as \"facial redness with mottled patterns like brocade, and sore throat.\" Both Yang and Yin toxins present with sore throat and expectoration of purulent blood. When the body is excessively hot, it is classified as Yang toxin, which corresponds to the syndrome of Shengma Bieja Decoction. If you observe \"a bluish complexion\" and \"body pain as if beaten with a stick,\" it resembles the sensation of being whipped. Why does this feeling occur? It is because the flow of blood has slowed down, to the point where it seems to be on the verge of stopping. Due to the patient's poor blood circulation, the entire body feels as if it has been struck by a whip, resulting in pain. The symptoms of body pain can also be seen in Ma Huang Decoction, which occurs because the exterior is constrained by cold, preventing the Yang from circulating normally throughout the body, thus causing pain. However, Yang syndrome is characterized by obstruction of the exterior water, while here, the Yin toxin is due to obstruction of blood circulation; the two are entirely different. Clinically, when using the prescriptions here, they include herpes, specifically what is known as shingles. The area affected by shingles feels as if it has been struck by a whip, causing significant pain; at this time, we can utilize these formulas. The formulas contain Bieja (tortoise shell), Xionghuang (realgar), and Shengma (cimicifuga). Shengma has been introduced in the materia medica; I previously mentioned Ma Huang Shengma Decoction. In addition to its role in promoting the flow of body fluids, Shengma also serves as an antidote, capable of detoxifying various poisons. At this time, Bieja is chosen because it is non-toxic in itself, but its nature is very strong and resilient. Moreover, Bieja enters the liver meridian. When Bieja encounters Danggui (angelica), since Bieja can penetrate deeply into the blood, when mixed with Danggui, it can reach the liver, and once it enters the liver, the liver will become...",

          "english_text": "Due to excessive sweating all over the body, one might jump into the water to cool off. However, it is not the case that swimming in the Yellow River causes the body to turn yellow; in fact, jumping into the Yangtze River can also result in yellow sweat. The sweat produced from exercise originates from the Sanjiao (Triple Burner). When the body is sweating and one jumps into the water, the cold water from outside seals the skin's pores. Once the surface is sealed, the internal heat causes the sweat to want to escape but it cannot, resulting in the appearance of the skin not being yellow, yet the sweat that comes out is yellow. This is what is referred to as yellow sweat. If you see a patient with yellow skin, that indicates jaundice. Yellow sweat means that the patient's skin does not appear yellow, but the sweat that is excreted is yellow. Historically, the individuals most likely to experience yellow sweat were ferry boatmen, with the most distinctive symptom being the appearance of yellow discoloration in the armpit area of their clothing, which is the manifestation of yellow sweat.\n\nThe pulse is floating and surging; a floating pulse indicates wind, while a surging pulse indicates qi. When wind and qi clash, if the wind is strong, it leads to itching and the body becomes itchy. Itching is a sign of wind being expelled, and if it persists, it can lead to scabs and leprosy. If the qi is strong, it leads to water retention, making it difficult to bend or stretch. When wind and qi are interconnected, the body becomes swollen, and sweating can lead to recovery. If one is averse to wind, this indicates a deficiency, which is classified as wind-water; if one is not averse to wind, it suggests smooth urination, with cold in the upper jiao (upper burner) and excessive salivation, which is indicative of yellow sweat.\n\nThe phrase \"the pulse is floating and surging; floating indicates wind, surging indicates qi\" means that when lightly palpating the pulse on the patient's wrist, if it is both floating and surging, it signifies that the internal qi is very strong. The qi in our body emerges from within, while wind comes from the outside. When we feel the cold wind from outside, our internal yang naturally rises to counteract the external pathogenic factors. Therefore, the qi that emerges from the body is what we refer to in Traditional Chinese Medicine. The term \"wind and qi clashing\" describes the interaction between our internal yang qi and the external wind.",

          "english_text": "Evil forces are in opposition, so what emerges from the body is Qi. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the term \"Qi\" is often used. The phrase \"wind Qi contending\" refers to the internal Yang Qi of our body resisting the external wind pathogen (filtered viruses). When the wind is stronger than the Yang Qi, it can lead to itching rashes. Itching rashes manifest as small, itchy red bumps on the skin. \"The body is itchy; itching leads to leakage.\" When there is itching, one naturally tends to scratch, and when the skin is scratched, Qi leaks out, resulting in reduced itching.\n\nIf the wind-induced itching persists, a patient can be given Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang (Ephedra and Atractylodes Decoction). This formula is Ma Huang Tang (Ephedra Decoction) with the addition of Bai Zhu (Atractylodes), aimed at inducing a slight amount of surface sweating from the skin; it does not require excessive sweating to achieve healing. The cause of the itching rash is that the body is supposed to sweat normally, but is obstructed by the external wind, causing the sweat pores to be constricted and preventing sweat from being expelled. At this time, sweat has already left the sweat glands but has not exited the pores, so it remains trapped beneath the skin, leading to itching. This is not a true skin disease; therefore, by using Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang to expel the trapped sweat, the itching rash can be resolved.\n\nMa Huang Jia Zhu Tang is well-designed for this purpose, as it can effectively release this layer of sweat without harming the normal body fluids. If one encounters ascites caused by liver disease, one might say, \"Teacher, can Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang expel water?\" When this medicine is taken, the patient may not feel anything because it is a different type of accumulated fluid. It is essential to confirm that the fluid is trapped beneath the skin before using Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang. If you are unaware that Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang specifically treats this type of itching rash and do not administer it to the patient, the wind rash, if left untreated for too long, will eventually develop into stubborn skin diseases such as scabs, leprosy, or scabies, among others.",

          "english_text": "The decoction specifically treats this type of itchy rash, so it was not given to the patient. When wind rash persists on the body for too long without treatment, it will eventually develop into stubborn skin diseases such as scabs, leprosy, or scabies, which are essentially forms of psoriasis. The initial cause of these conditions arises in this manner. Otherwise, why would the rash appear on your body and not on someone else's? I once treated a patient with psoriasis who had a very large body type; when the skin was pulled, there were large patches that were red and resembled fish scales, arranged in neat layers. When scraped, a lot of dry skin would come off, and soon after, it would grow back. I intentionally described it in a rather disgusting way; as a doctor, one should not be afraid of such things. After examining one side, the patient would then show me the other side, saying, \"Ah! I have it on my back too!\" When he pulled up his pants, there were patches all over his legs, with a large area on his thigh—his entire body was affected. Currently, Western medicine does not have effective treatments for such psoriasis. \n\nWhen encountering this type of skin disease, it is important to understand that the cause of the rash is due to damp-heat within the body. If this damp-heat is not eliminated over a long period, and if sweat does not properly dissipate, it leads to the gradual accumulation of sweat beneath the skin. Meanwhile, the heat in the spleen and stomach cannot be expelled, causing it to become trapped inside and transform into damp-heat. At this point, if acupuncture is used for treatment, we can select anti-inflammatory points that are effective for skin diseases, such as Quchi (LI11), Hegu (LI4), Sanyinjiao (SP6), Xuehai (SP10), and Zhubin (SP9), which are specifically for treating skin itching. Additionally, we can puncture and release blood at the sites where the rash appears, and then apply a topical powder made from Sanhuang Xiexin Decoction mixed with a bit of Baizhu powder as an external remedy. Internally, Wumei Wan can be taken. Wumei Wan is a bitter and warm medicine; its bitter and warm properties can help transform dampness, such as the dampness associated with liver diseases, which relies on Wumei Wan for treatment.",

A woman who is supposed to have her menstrual period once a month may experience it four or five times instead.

A man's essence is similar to a woman's breast milk in that it is white. A woman's breast milk is transformed from nutrients by the heat of the heart before descending to the uterus to become blood, while a man's essence is formed by the heat of the small intestine.

Therefore, those with bleeding disorders, such as epistaxis, blood loss, or ulcerative conditions, should not be induced to sweat. Additionally, if a patient has numerous ulcers on their body, you should not induce sweating in that case either.\n\nA patient may present with fullness in the chest, dry lips, a bluish tongue, and a dry mouth, desiring to rinse with water but not to swallow, without any signs of cold or heat.

Some individuals may experience it due to incomplete expulsion of lochia after childbirth, while others may have it due to internal injuries or trauma. Various accidents can also lead to blood stasis in the body. There are several symptoms that can help us in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnose whether a patient has blood stasis. \n\nThe first symptom is \"chest fullness,\" where the patient feels a sensation of fullness in the chest. The second symptom is \"dry and shriveled lips,\" where the lips appear dry and contracted. Why is this the case? I will explain shortly, but first, let’s note a few important symptoms. The second symptom is \"blue tongue and dry mouth,\" indicating dryness in the mouth and a bluish color of the tongue. In TCM, the concept is that \"the heart governs blood.\" Therefore, when there is blood stasis, the blood's return to the heart is insufficient, leading to the sensation of chest fullness. \n\nFor instance, when we use Guizhi Decoction, if we encounter a patient with chest fullness, we need to remove Bai Shao (white peony root) because patients with heart issues will experience chest fullness. Additionally, the spleen governs transportation and transformation; it is associated with the earth element and is yellow in color. The spleen plays a crucial role in the transportation of nutrients within the body. During the process of blood production, if there is blood stasis blocking the body, this stasis may be in the stomach or intestines, but regardless, the presence of blood stasis indicates a problem with blood circulation. Consequently, normal blood cannot be transported to the limbs. \n\nMoreover, the spleen opens to the lips, so at this time, we can observe that the patient's mouth is relatively dry and withered, lacking moisture. The tongue appears bluish, but this bluish color is not uniform across the entire tongue; it is observed on both sides of the tongue body. This is something I have seen clinically many times. Generally, when encountering someone with internal injuries, extending the tongue reveals...",

          "english_text": "The entire tongue appears bluish-green, particularly on both sides of the tongue body. This observation is derived from clinical experience, as I have seen many cases. Generally, when encountering individuals with internal injuries, if they extend their tongue and both sides appear bluish, it indicates the presence of internal injury. Additionally, patients may experience significant dryness in the mouth due to blood stasis obstructing the back, where blood has already left the blood vessels and accumulated in the muscle tissue or between the organs, leading to such symptoms. Patients may express a desire to rinse their mouths but do not wish to swallow; this reflects a psychological craving for water, yet when the water reaches their mouths, they do not want to ingest it. These symptoms are all indicative of external manifestations of blood stasis.\n\nIn our clinical practice, we have observed many women who, after undergoing surgery for breast cancer, experience extreme dryness in the mouth, finding it difficult to drink water, and if they do manage to drink, they end up vomiting it back. This is due to the presence of blood stasis within the body, which hinders proper blood circulation, resulting in intense thirst, yet they cannot retain the water they consume.\n\nThe term \"no cold or heat\" indicates that when observing a patient's dry tongue, it may suggest Yangming heat. When we palpate the pulse, if there is no indication of cold or heat, and no exterior or interior symptoms, \"no cold or heat\" means there are no exterior symptoms present. The pulse of blood stasis is slightly larger and arrives late; this requires clinical experience to discern through palpation. \n\nWhen a patient states, \"My abdomen is not full, yet I feel very bloated,\" it means that upon examination, the patient's abdomen does not appear distended, but they continuously report a sensation of fullness and discomfort inside. This also indicates the presence of blood stasis within. All of the above are symptoms associated with internal blood stasis.\n\nYou mentioned: \"Teacher, today I encountered a mute person whose hair was very long, and their face was obscured.\" Or if someone has sustained an injury and their face is bruised, making it difficult to see, how do you examine them? Traditional Chinese Medicine has methods to assess blood stasis...",

          "english_text": "\"Then, his hair is very long, and his face is covered.\" Or he might have suffered an injury, and his face is bruised, making it hard for us to see. How can you examine him? In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), there are very specific methods to check for blood stasis. When there is stasis in the body, there are several areas that can be examined, and this applies to both men and women. The left side of the human body is associated with blood, while the right side is associated with qi. In the lower left abdomen, above the Chongmen point, there is a tender point, and there is also tenderness below the seventh vertebra in the back, because blood can accumulate in the Ge Shu area. When pressure is applied to these locations, even if the person is mute, there will be a strong reaction, such as the legs retracting or the brow furrowing.\n\nAdditionally, the Sanyinjiao point is where three yin meridians intersect. The term \"yin\" refers to the deepest areas, while \"yang\" refers to the surface; yin is relatively deeper. When there is blood stasis within the organs, the blood does not remain stagnant; it gradually seeps into deeper tissues, at which point it enters the yin areas. Yin areas are not necessarily the genital region; for example, when there is blood stasis deep within the organs, such as beneath the liver or spleen, tender points can be found at Sanyinjiao, which can be observed clinically.\n\nThe most obvious and easily observable sign is the tongue. By extending the tongue, one can immediately discern the presence of blood stasis. For instance, if a woman's tongue has many indentations along the sides, it indicates gynecological issues. Additionally, some individuals may have a bluish tongue with patchy distributions, which also signifies blood stasis. When blood stasis is present, we must first address it; resolving the stasis will alleviate the condition. Methods to address blood stasis include formulas like Taohua Chengqi Decoction and Ditang Decoction, which are designed to move stasis. When addressing blood stasis, it is crucial to be particularly careful with the prescription; we must assess the patient and determine the specific location of the stasis.",

Drink the first bowl, and do not drink again if there is \"down\" (referring to blood in the stool); do not be nervous, as the fetus in the abdomen will not be harmed.\n\nThe definition of the original formula by Dong Dongweng states: \"To treat those with blood stasis, there are two types of blood stasis. One is when there is pain in the lower abdomen and frequent urination; the other is when the abdomen is not distended, yet the person feels fullness. For urgent cases, use decoction; for less urgent cases, use pills.\" Difficulty in urination indicates blood stasis in the bladder, which corresponds to the Peach Kernel Chengqi Decoction. Frequent urination corresponds to the Didao Decoction. Additionally, if the abdomen feels soft and the patient experiences discomfort in the abdomen, this is also a blood condition. For urgent cases, use decoctions; for less urgent cases, use pills. Generally speaking, if the condition is superficial, the pain will be very acute; if the condition is deeper, the pain may be less urgent. Therefore, pills are used. Why use pills? Pills are characterized by their \"gentle and focused medicinal power.\" For \"acute conditions,\" it is necessary to expel quickly, hence decoctions are used. Decoctions are for cleansing; for gastrointestinal issues, powdered medicine is preferable.\n\nThe \"Fang Yu Nao\" states: \"In cases of upper syndrome, those with body deficiency are often afflicted. A body deficiency, even with blood stasis in the lower abdomen, should not be attacked. However, if not attacked, the illness will not resolve. Well said! Chen Ziming removed 'rhubarb' from this formula and added 'rehmannia,' naming it 'Tongjing Pill.' With just this one modification, it effectively balances the need to attack and defend, surpassing even the strategies of Sun Wu. I have often used these four ingredients, decocted in water, to treat 'dry blood labor' with great efficacy.\" \"Dry blood labor\" refers to blood that has dried up in the abdominal cavity. The patient's external symptoms include \"skin peeling,\" which is often seen in young girls, particularly on the legs and abdomen, and occurs every winter when the skin sheds.",

This manifests as shedding skin on the legs and abdomen during winter, where the skin becomes dry and resembles snake skin, while in summer, it appears normal. This condition is essentially \"dry blood deficiency.\"\n\n139. \"Taiyang disease\" presents with jaundice, a deep and tight pulse, hardness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, indicating a lack of blood. If urination is smooth, the person may appear manic, which is a sign of blood stasis; \"Dingdang Decoction\" is indicated for this condition.\n\nThis can be further divided into two categories: one with smooth urination and one with difficulty in urination, to differentiate between blood presence and absence. If there is no blood, the patient will present with jaundice, a deep and tight pulse, hardness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, indicating a lack of blood. In such cases, \"Yinchenhao Decoction\" will be used. Yinchenhao Decoction specifically targets heat in the bladder. When there is heat burning below, after the bladder has been vaporized, some unhealthy urine is expelled while some good fluid enters the gallbladder, secreting bile to aid digestion. Bile is yellow; if there is excessive heat in the bladder, the secretion of bile becomes too heated, leading to jaundice in the patient. \n\nDo not underestimate blood stasis; it may not be visible on X-rays, yet it can lead to manic behavior in patients. This stasis can sometimes travel to the brain. Depending on the situation, either \"Dachengqi Decoction\" or \"Dingdang Decoction\" may be used. Therefore, it is important to observe the urination patterns. If urination is smooth, \"Dingdang Decoction\" should be used. If the urine is very yellow, it indicates excessive heat in the lower jiao, and if there is constipation, \"Dachengqi Decoction\" should be employed to purge.\n\n140. In \"Shanghan\" (cold damage), if there is heat, fullness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, but the urination is now normal, it indicates the presence of blood. In this case, it should be purged immediately without leaving any medicine behind, and \"Dingdang Pill\" is recommended.\n\nHeat accumulation in the bladder should typically result in difficulty urinating; however, if urination is normal, and the patient reports pain in the lower abdomen around the \"Zhongji\" and \"Guanyuan\" areas, the pain is due to obstruction. If urination is good, it suggests that blood is blocked.",

The difficulty in urination may be due to kidney stones, and the use of Wuling San (Five-Ingredient Powder) could help to resolve this. Currently, the patient feels a lot of pain, but upon palpation, the abdomen is soft, suggesting that there is stagnant blood inside. To differentiate whether there is blood stagnation, we assess the urination. \n\nIt is advised not to use any remaining medications and to specifically use Diding Wan (Resisting the Counteracting Pill).

The symptoms appear milder than those treated with Diding Decoction, but the underlying condition is more severe. \n\nDiding Wan formula:\n- 20 pieces of leeches (boiled)\n- 25 pieces of fly larvae (boiled, wings removed)\n- 20 pieces of peach kernels (peeled and pointed ends removed)\n- 3 taels of rhubarb (soaked in wine)\n\nCombine these four ingredients, pound them into four pills, and use one pill with one liter of water, boiling it down to seven cups for consumption. If blood is expelled, it should be taken immediately. If not, take another dose. \n\nPeach kernels are sticky, and crushed leeches are also sticky, so divide them into four pills. Generally, 20 leeches weigh about 2 qian, 25 fly larvae are approximately 2.5 qian, 20 peach kernels weigh 2 qian, and rhubarb is 3 qian. The term \"晬時\" refers to the time after taking the medicine today, which is at least 24 hours for blood to be expelled. If blood is expelled, no further doses are needed; if not, take another pill. Each person's amount of stagnant blood varies, so while the prescription remains the same, the dosage may differ. Stop taking the medication once the desired effect is achieved.\n\nAccording to the \"Liuju Fang Guangyi,\" this formula states: \"In my family, we use this formula, taking the four left ingredients and grinding them into a powder, then refining with honey into pills.\" Using raw honey will enhance the effect. It also states: \"If it forms into lumps, for chronic patients, even if they usually take medicine, it is difficult to achieve results, and later there will be further divisions.\"",

          "english_text": "In comparison to heat, when the internal deficiency heat interacts with the external yang heat, the patient feels very uncomfortable. In winter, this condition tends to improve because the cold outside can restrain the heat. Additionally, individuals with severe labor syndrome may experience the phenomenon of \"yin cold essence spontaneously emerging.\"\n\nZhang Zhongjing simply explained that most people suffering from labor syndrome have heat above and cold below, meaning that the area above the navel is hot while the area below is cold. The navel serves as the boundary between yin and yang. The lower part is characterized by yin cold, which signifies a lack of dynamic energy and a cessation of peristalsis, leading to poor metabolism. Conversely, the upper part is excessively hot and overactive. In a healthy individual, yin is above and yang is below, which prevents yang from floating upwards and allows our dynamic energy to be concealed, referred to as \"latent yang.\" In Traditional Chinese Medicine, it is not the quantity of yang that matters, but rather its ability to remain hidden.\n\nTherefore, if a patient has yang heat above that cannot descend, this heat will rise to the limbs. At this time, the lower jiao becomes a gathering place for yin cold, leading to \"essence spontaneously emerging.\" The patient may exhibit several symptoms; for men, this may manifest as nocturnal emissions or dreams of sexual intercourse. Older individuals often experience spontaneous essence leakage due to yang deficiency, which they cannot control, resulting in involuntary loss of essence. This symptom is very distressing, but can be effectively treated with Chinese herbal medicine.\n\nFurthermore, the symptom of \"soreness and weakness preventing movement\" arises because the lower jiao is deficient and cold, causing essence to leak out. Women do not possess essence, but when this phenomenon occurs in females, it results in excessive vaginal discharge that continuously drips, which can also lead to a sense of depletion. When this occurs, it can affect sleep at night. Since the kidneys govern the bones,",

Since the kidneys govern the bones, if a patient loses too much kidney essence, they will experience soreness in the bones. The term \"soreness that prevents movement\" refers to the patient feeling soreness in the bones rather than in the muscles. Therefore, some individuals who have suffered from labor-related conditions for many years without treatment may eventually develop nocturnal emissions. When this essence continuously leaks out, the patient cannot endure it, leading to significant distress and daily fatigue. We have Chinese herbal medicine that can help stabilize their Yang deficiency, as well as herbs that can replenish their Yin deficiency, among other treatments.\n\nIn men, a weak and floating pulse indicates infertility, with clear and cold essence. Here, the term \"floating and weak pulse\" represents the Qi pulse; when the pulse is floating, it indicates that the Qi is rising, meaning the patient's exterior is deficient. A weak pulse signifies insufficient blood, indicating that the patient's essence and blood are inadequate, which reflects an internal deficiency. Patients exhibiting this phenomenon will certainly struggle with fertility, as their essence is \"clear and cold.\" Such men find it difficult to conceive, meaning that those with labor-related conditions are less likely to become pregnant. However, we have prescriptions in Chinese medicine that can treat this condition. You can refer to the formula below; after trying one or two doses, you will know whether it is effective.\n\nThus, if a 17 or 18-year-old child has a pale complexion, it indicates that they are in the early stages of development, and this physiological response may cause them to experience nocturnal emissions during sleep. If it happens occasionally, one or two times, it is quite normal and not a significant concern, as fullness leads to overflow. However, if it becomes severe, the individual may become deficient, and at this point, their complexion will appear pale, and they will exhibit a lack of energy. This corresponds to the pattern of Gui Zhi Long Gu Mu Li Tang.",

This corresponds to the syndrome treated by Gui Zhi Long Gu Mu Li Tang (Cinnamon Twig, Dragon Bone, and Oyster Decoction).\n\nIn cases of seminal loss, there is a tightness in the lower abdomen, coldness in the genital area, dizziness, hair loss, and a pulse that is extremely weak, thin, and slow, indicating a deficiency of essence and blood. The pulse may feel slightly tight and moving, with men experiencing seminal loss and women having dreams of sexual intercourse; Gui Zhi Long Gu Mu Li Tang is indicated for these conditions.\n\nThe formula for Gui Zhi Long Gu Mu Li Tang includes:\n- 3 taels of Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig)\n- 3 taels of Shao Yao (Peony Root)\n- 3 taels of Sheng Jiang (Fresh Ginger)\n- 2 taels of Gan Cao (Licorice)\n- 12 pieces of Da Zao (Jujube)\n- 3 taels of Long Gu (Dragon Bone)\n- 3 taels of Mu Li (Oyster Shell)\n\nCombine these seven ingredients with 7 sheng (approximately 2.2 liters) of water, boil down to 3 sheng (approximately 1 liter), and divide into three warm doses.\n\nIn general, both insufficient essence and unstable essence fall under the category of seminal loss, which is what is referred to as a patient with \"deficiency labor.\" The \"tightness in the lower abdomen\" is caused by damage to the kidney yang, resulting in a sensation as if a tendon is being pulled inside the lower abdomen. This occurs because water cannot nourish wood; the liver governs the tendons, and without water to moisten the liver wood, the tendons become tight, as the liver's tendons are directly connected to the lower abdomen. Typically, if there is pain in the lower abdomen, it is often due to excessive cold in the spleen, and at this time, classical herbalists would frequently use Bai Shao (White Peony) to alleviate abdominal pain. However, in this situation, using Bai Shao is ineffective because the patient is experiencing \"tight tendons,\" which is due to liver deficiency.\n\nThe term \"coldness in the genital area\" indicates that even the area at the front of the genitals feels icy. At this time, there must also be accompanying dizziness. \"Hair loss\" refers to the loss of hair as well. The pulse being \"extremely weak, thin, and slow\" signifies that the internal essence is severely depleted. The condition of \"diarrhea with clear grains and loss of blood and essence\" means that food ingested is not properly absorbed due to excessive cold in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to undigested food being expelled. This is what is meant by diarrhea with clear grains. The patient originally has insufficient blood, and now, with the addition of fluid loss...",

There are three types of diabetes symptoms: the first type is upper-jiao diabetes, with the main symptom being severe thirst; no matter how much water one drinks, the thirst cannot be quenched. As soon as Ren Shen Bai Hu Tang is consumed, after a few doses, blood sugar levels will return to normal. The second type is lower-jiao diabetes, characterized by impotence; Shen Qi Wan may need to be taken for a longer duration, around six months continuously. The third type is middle-jiao diabetes, where one feels hungry even after eating a hundred bowls, caused by excessive heat in the spleen, which is what I am going to introduce now.\n\nWhen treating middle-jiao thirst, the prescription must pay attention to two main points: first, it is necessary to slow down the gastric motility, which means reducing stomach fire. Second, it is essential to clear out the waste from the large intestine simultaneously, because the large intestine is inherently hot. If a lot of waste accumulates inside, the heat cannot dissipate and becomes trapped, leading to increased heat. Therefore, it must be cleared out at the same time. These pathogenic causes are closely related to the busy social behaviors of our current industrial and commercial society, as well as our lifestyle habits. \n\nSitting at work every day means that our blood sugar levels require more movement to be consumed. However, due to excessive time spent sitting in the office and a lack of exercise, combined with sometimes being too busy to eat a proper meal during the day, we end up having a late-night snack when we return home and then go to sleep. Consequently, food remains in the stomach for too long. Ideally, it is healthier for our stomach to be empty while we sleep, as gastric motility gradually slows down during sleep. If we eat a lot of food before sleeping, the stomach will be occupied with food, and the stomach...",

If a person eats a lot of food before going to bed, the stomach, which contains food, cannot remain inactive and thus becomes compressed. Normally, at night, the stomach fire decreases and peristalsis slows down. However, if food is consumed, it stimulates the stomach to continue moving, resulting in a situation where the stomach is active while the person is asleep. Over time, this can lead to elevated blood sugar levels. \n\nWestern medicine states that diabetes can be hereditary, but this is a partial truth; it should be prefaced with the phrase \"lifestyle habits.\" It is not a matter of hereditary constitution. Today, if the pancreas becomes fatty, it does not mean that a son will also inherit a fatty pancreas—such a thing does not happen. In reality, it is due to shared lifestyle habits. For instance, a father who is busy working in a factory or company may not see his wife and children all day. When he returns home late, he calls out, \"Everyone get up and eat with Dad; I want to chat with you.\" Thus, the family ends up having late-night snacks together, discussing school matters, and then going to bed, repeating this pattern daily. \n\nIf the father's lifestyle habits are unhealthy, he may develop diabetes, and consequently, the son may adopt the same late-night snacking habit, leading to diabetes in the son as well.

Many people develop habits of late-night eating, and by the time they reach their fifties, although they have earned money, they find themselves diagnosed with diabetes when they want to enjoy life. In Chinese culture, there is a saying, \"Food is the heaven for the people,\" indicating that diet is a form of enjoyment in life. However, due to diabetes, they cannot eat freely. Children who grow up eating late-night snacks with their fathers also develop this habit; if they don’t eat, their hands and feet tremble, and they must eat before they can sleep. This is the reason behind it.\n\nThere are also external symptoms; Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) believes that if the exterior symptoms are not treated, the disease can progress to the Yangming stage, leading to persistent thirst and dryness, which is another pathogenic cause. Zhang Zhongjing did not prescribe for middle consumption (a term referring to digestive issues), which is actually what I use in my formula, Ze Lan Wan. Diabetic patients tend to gain weight due to insulin injections and blood sugar-lowering medications, not because they are diabetic. If there were a medication that not only prevents weight gain but also promotes weight loss, the mere fact that patients lose weight would indicate a decrease in blood sugar levels.\n\nFor the condition of thirst due to middle-jiao deficiency, it is essential to design a prescription that reduces stomach fire while also promoting bowel movement. Originally, patients would eat a hundred bowls and still feel hungry, but after taking Chinese medicine, they would feel full after eating just a little, indicating that their stomach has shrunk. At this point, the temperature of the spleen and stomach immediately drops, and the heat in the large intestine is expelled along with the stool. \n\nIn ancient times, there were no airplanes or cars; visiting neighbors required walking several kilometers, so most people had a lot of physical activity. Therefore, this disease is more common among the wealthy. Nowadays, with many cars and a life of comfort, people sit without moving, leading to a significant increase in diabetes cases.

For urgent cases, use decoctions; for less urgent cases, use pills. Generally speaking, if the condition is superficial, the pain will be very urgent; if the condition is deeper, the pain will be less urgent. Therefore, pills are used. Why use pills? Pills are characterized by their \"gentle and focused medicinal power.\" For \"acute\" conditions that need to be expelled quickly, decoctions are used, as decoctions are cleansing.

This manifests as shedding skin on the legs and abdomen every winter, where the skin becomes dry and resembles snake skin, while in summer, it appears normal. This condition is essentially \"dry blood deficiency.\"\n\n139. \"Taiyang disease\" presents with jaundice, a deep and tight pulse, hardness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, indicating a lack of blood. If urination is smooth, the person may appear manic, which is a sign of blood stasis; \"Dingdang Decoction\" is indicated for this condition.\n\nThis can be further divided into two categories: one with smooth urination and one with difficulty in urination, to differentiate between blood presence and absence. If there is no blood, the patient will exhibit jaundice, a deep and tight pulse, hardness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, indicating a lack of blood. In such cases, \"Yinchenhao Decoction\" will be used. Yinchenhao Decoction specifically targets heat in the bladder. When there is heat burning below, after the bladder has been vaporized, some unhealthy urine is expelled while some good fluids enter the gallbladder, aiding in digestion through bile secretion. Bile is yellow; if there is excessive heat in the bladder, the secretion of bile becomes too heated, leading to jaundice in the patient. \n\nOne should not underestimate blood stasis; it may not be visible on X-rays, yet it can lead to manic behavior in patients. This stasis can sometimes travel to the brain. Depending on the situation, one might use \"Dachengqi Decoction\" or \"Dingdang Decoction.\" Therefore, it is essential to observe whether urination is smooth or difficult. If urination is smooth but the urine is very yellow, it indicates excessive heat in the lower jiao, and if there is constipation, \"Dachengqi Decoction\" should be used to purge.\n\n140. In \"Shanghan\" (cold damage), if there is heat, fullness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, but the patient is now experiencing smooth urination, this indicates the presence of blood stasis. It is necessary to purge immediately without leaving any medication behind, and \"Dingdang Pill\" is recommended.\n\nHeat accumulation in the bladder should typically result in difficulty urinating; however, if urination is normal, and the patient reports pain in the lower abdomen around the \"Zhongji\" and \"Guanyuan\" areas, the pain arises from obstruction. If urination is good, it indicates that blood is blocked.",

          "english_text": "The patient initially experienced difficulty urinating, but now their urination is normal. The patient reports significant pain in the lower abdomen, particularly around the \"Zhongji\" and \"Guanyuan\" areas. The pain is associated with obstruction; however, urination is good, indicating that blood is blocked. The difficulty in urination may be due to kidney stones, and the use of Wuling San (Five-Ingredient Powder) could help alleviate this. Currently, the patient is feeling a lot of pain, but upon palpation, the abdomen is soft, suggesting that there is stagnant blood inside. To diagnose whether there is blood stagnation, we assess the ease of urination. \"No excess medicine should be used; it is advisable to use Dìdàng Wán (Di Dang Pill).\" Other medications are ineffective; it is essential to use Dìdàng Wán. The symptoms appear milder compared to those treated with Dìdàng Tāng (Di Dang Decoction), but the underlying condition is more severe.\n\n**Dìdàng Wán Formula:**\n- 20 pieces of leeches (boiled)\n- 25 pieces of fly larvae (boiled, wings removed)\n- 20 pieces of peach kernels (peeled and pointed ends removed)\n- 3 taels of rhubarb (soaked in wine)\n\nCombine these four ingredients, pound them into four pills, and use one pill with one liter of water, boiling it down to seven cups for consumption. If blood is expelled, it should be taken immediately; if not, take another dose. \n\nPeach kernels are very sticky, and crushed leeches are also sticky, so divide the mixture into four pills. Generally, 20 leeches weigh about 2 qian, 25 fly larvae are approximately 2.5 qian, 20 peach kernels weigh 2 qian, and rhubarb is 3 qian. \"晬\" refers to the time after taking the medicine today, which is at least 24 hours for blood to be expelled. If blood is expelled, there is no need to continue taking the medicine; if not, take another pill. Each person's amount of stagnant blood varies, so while the prescription remains the same, the dosage may differ. Stop once the desired effect is achieved.\n\nAccording to the \"Lèijù Fāng Guǎngyì,\" this formula states: \"In my family, we use this formula, taking the four left ingredients to make a powder and then refining it with honey into pills.\" Using raw honey will enhance the effect. It also states: \"If it forms into lumps, for chronic patients, even if they usually take medicine, it may be difficult to achieve results thereafter.\"",

          "english_text": "In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), one must wait until the internal deficiency has been resolved before administering exterior-releasing herbs. Therefore, when encountering a patient with internal deficiency, it is essential to first treat the internal deficiency before addressing the exterior symptoms.\n\n116. For \"Taiyang disease,\" if it has persisted for more than ten days and has recurred two or three times, and after another four or five days the \"Chaihu syndrome\" is still present, one should first administer \"Xiao Chai Hu Tang.\" If the patient experiences persistent vomiting, a sense of urgency in the chest, and mild irritability, this indicates that the condition has not been resolved; in this case, administering \"Da Chai Hu Tang\" will lead to recovery.\n\nThe phrase \"more than ten days\" indicates that the illness has been prolonged for over ten days, and logically, it should have progressed to another stage. However, if the exterior symptoms persist and the physician does not prescribe exterior-releasing herbs but instead resorts to purging, the original Taiyang syndrome, which should have released the exterior and allowed the illness to manifest outwardly, instead becomes internalized. If after another four or five days the Chaihu syndrome is still present, one should first give Xiao Chai Hu Tang. If after taking Xiao Chai Hu Tang the patient still experiences \"persistent vomiting, urgency in the chest, and mild irritability,\" this indicates that the stomach is distended and uncomfortable due to retained food, which has not been resolved. In this case, administering Da Chai Hu Tang will lead to recovery.\n\nDa Chai Hu Tang itself is situated between the Shaoyang and Yangming stages, and it is used when there are symptoms of both Shaoyang and Yangming. The symptoms of \"persistent vomiting, urgency in the chest, and mild irritability\" suggest that the intestines and stomach are obstructed by fecal matter, with retained food causing blockage. Therefore, the primary symptoms of Da Chai Hu Tang include abdominal fullness, distension, and vomiting. Vomiting is associated with Shaoyang, while abdominal fullness is associated with Yangming. Abdominal fullness and nausea are the main symptoms of Da Chai Hu Tang. In modern cases, gas fullness corresponds to the symptoms treated by Hou Po, Sheng Jiang, Ban Xia, and Gan Cao decoction; actual fullness corresponds to Cheng Qi decoction; and abdominal fullness with nausea corresponds to Da Chai Hu Tang. If there is only vomiting without abdominal fullness, it corresponds to Xiao Chai Hu Tang syndrome. Why is this the case? Because the purging herbs were too aggressive, leading to excessive loss of fluids, resulting in watery stools.",

          "english_text": "The presence of abdominal fullness and light vomiting indicates a Xiao Chai Hu Tang syndrome. Why is that? Because the condition has been attacked and the purgative medicine has acted too quickly, causing the patient to lose fluids. The stools that are expelled are mostly watery, resulting in a situation where the solid stools remain trapped inside. Clinically, we observe that patients with colorectal cancer initially present with either Cheng Qi Tang syndrome or Da Chai Hu Tang syndrome. They are not in the Yangming stage, but rather in a state between Shaoyang and Yangming. In Yangming, there are no signs of death, and this situation is not dangerous. However, patients treated by Western medicine who undergo surgery may develop liver cancer or lung cancer afterward, presenting symptoms that align with either Shaoyin syndrome or Jueyin syndrome. Therefore, we naturally oppose surgical interventions by Western medicine.\n\nFor patients with colorectal cancer who have not yet undergone surgery, if the blockage is near the end of the colon, specifically around the rectum, we should add Mang Xiao to break the blockage. When we encounter constipation with excess patterns, where the patient resists abdominal palpation and cannot pass gas, we should consider using Mang Xiao.\n\nThe formula for Da Chai Hu Tang is as follows:\n- Chai Hu: 250 grams\n- Huang Qin: 150 grams\n- Shao Yao: 150 grams\n- Ban Xia: 75 grams (washed)\n- Sheng Jiang: 250 grams (sliced)\n- Zhi Shi: 4 pieces (roasted)\n- Da Zao: 12 pieces (split)\n- Da Huang: 100 grams (approximately 75 grams of Ban Xia)\n\nCombine these eight ingredients with 12 liters of water, boil down to 6 liters, strain, and then re-boil to obtain 3 liters. Administer 1 liter warm, three times a day.\n\nFor Da Huang, heavier individuals can use 6 grams, while lighter individuals can use 3 grams. The combination of Chai Hu, Huang Qin, Ban Xia, Sheng Jiang, and Da Zao constitutes the Xiao Chai Hu Tang formula. By omitting Ren Shen and Gan Cao, and adding Shao Yao, Zhi Shi, and Da Huang, we create the Da Chai Hu Tang. Zhi Shi is also a medicine that can help widen the intestines, similar to Hou Po. However, Zhi Shi is more focused on expanding the large intestine, while Hou Po is more effective for moistening the small intestine. The large intestine and lungs are interrelated, so when there is a blockage in the large intestine, Zhi Shi should be used.",

          "english_text": "In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the herb Zhi Shi (bitter orange) is similar to Hou Po (magnolia bark) but is more focused on the large intestine, while Hou Po is more about moistening the small intestine. The large intestine and lungs are interrelated, so when there is a blockage in the large intestine, Zhi Shi is used. It is also applied when there is congestion in the chest cavity or fluid accumulation in the heart. Zhi Shi is specifically effective in eliminating toxic masses and hard lumps, facilitating their expulsion. \n\nIn practice, it has been observed that when the intestinal wall of the large intestine adheres to the stool, Zhi Shi can help separate them. However, it can only create separation; if Zhi Shi were to clear it out completely, there would be no need to add Da Huang (rhubarb) or Mang Xiao (mirabilite). Therefore, Zhi Shi itself does not have a purgative function; it merely separates the blockage, and other herbs are required to facilitate the passage.\n\nWhen there is a blockage in the arterial blood vessels of the heart, Zhi Shi is used, but it only separates the obstructive material from the vessel walls. Zhang Zhongjing also added Gui Zhi (cinnamon twig) to enhance the outward force of the heart's arterial blood vessels, increasing the ejection power. To prevent the stomach from being overwhelmed, Sheng Jiang (fresh ginger) is added to disperse some of the heat, preventing it from concentrating too much on the heart, which could lead to rupture of the blood vessels.\n\nDue to abdominal fullness and distension, there may be pain in the lower abdomen, so Shao Yao (peony) is added. If Da Huang is not included in the formula for Da Chai Hu Tang (Major Bupleurum Decoction), it cannot be called Da Chai Hu Tang. This is because the condition has already entered the Shao Yang and Yang Ming stages, and it is not a pure Yang Ming syndrome, so there is no need for a strong herb like Mang Xiao. Da Huang is sufficient to clear the Yang Ming heat.\n\nDa Chai Hu Tang is essentially Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Minor Bupleurum Decoction) with Ren Shen (ginseng) and Gan Cao (licorice) removed, and Zhi Shi, Da Huang, and Shao Yao added. In cases of Yang Ming excess heat, it is inappropriate to use Ren Shen and Gan Cao, which are tonifying herbs, because the Yang Ming condition has already affected the intestines. One should not use Gan Cao to keep the herbs stagnant in the stomach, as Yang Ming excess heat is present.",

When presenting with the \"Banxia Xiexin Decoction syndrome,\" the patient will definitely experience vomiting, diarrhea, and intestinal rumbling; thus, the presence of vomiting indicates the need for \"Banxia Xiexin Decoction.\"\n\nAccording to \"Fangweng Yitan\": \"The 'resting dysentery' is generally considered difficult to treat, likely due to the incomplete expulsion of foul substances. It is advisable to take 'Duluo Pill' (Duluo Pill is a formula consisting solely of the herb 'Dahuang').\" Simply taking Dahuang alone can lead to severe diarrhea; the Duluo Pill is guaranteed to induce a bowel movement, but this method is not effective. Furthermore: \"If the diarrhea resembles resting dysentery, without pus or blood, but only watery stools that may occasionally stop, and when it stops, the abdomen becomes distended, with the diarrhea being refreshing, yet the person becomes increasingly weak, with a sallow complexion, nausea, and sour regurgitation, and sometimes abdominal pain, then 'Banxia Xiexin Decoction' should be administered.\" If there is no blood in the stool and only water is expelled, when the diarrhea ceases, the abdomen becomes distended, but after the bowel movement, the abdomen feels comfortable. However, the complexion becomes increasingly fatigued, accompanied by nausea and sourness, making it difficult to eat.\n\nIn cases where \"Taiyang\" and \"Shaoyang\" diseases are concurrent, and there is a reversal leading to \"Jiexiong\" (stagnation in the chest), with hardness below the heart, persistent diarrhea, and an inability to retain fluids, the person becomes agitated. \n\nLogically, when \"Taiyang and Shaoyang diseases are concurrent,\" one would typically use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, or if there are more external symptoms, Chai Hu Gui Zhi Decoction could also be appropriate. However, if there is a reversal leading to Jiexiong, with hardness below the heart, persistent diarrhea, and an inability to retain fluids, this situation is concerning and serves as a warning sign. The term \"Jiexiong\" indicates a solid blockage, suggesting that something is obstructing the flow. During Jiexiong, the abdomen feels hard and is accompanied by Yangming interior excess, indicating a complete lack of bowel movements. This condition is relatively easy to treat; once the stool is expelled, the patient feels better. However, if Jiexiong is accompanied by persistent diarrhea, it indicates insufficient gastrointestinal fluids, leading to further complications.",

          "english_text": "Here is the translation of the provided Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) text:\n\n---\n\nIn cases of constipation, there is fundamentally no bowel movement, and everything has hardened. This is easy to treat; once the stool is passed, the condition improves. Currently, there is a combination of chest distension and persistent diarrhea, indicating that the gastrointestinal fluids are insufficient. The patient cannot drink water and is continuously experiencing diarrhea. Therefore, the Da Xian Xiao Decoction cannot be used. What is the underlying issue? It could be stomach cancer or pancreatic cancer, where something is growing inside and causing a blockage. \"The patient feels irritable,\" and this irritability indicates that the patient is in a state of deficiency, which is quite dangerous. The prescription for pancreatic cancer is described in the Jue Yin chapter with the formula of Gan Jiang, Huang Lian, Huang Qin, and Ren Shen Decoction.\n\nDiscussion on Stomach Cancer:\nIn clinical practice, we prescribe according to classical formulas, using Ge Gen to generate fluids. The Ge Gen, Qin Lian Decoction is used to treat diarrhea and to harmonize and relieve heat. When there is fluid accumulation in the middle jiao, we use Chai Hu to regulate and open the San Jiao, allowing it to enter the lymphatic system. When there are growths or tumors, Chai Hu is an excellent guiding herb that can help clear the lymphatic system. Because the patient is experiencing vomiting, we add Ban Xia. The gastrointestinal fluids have been damaged, so we add Gan Cao to replenish these fluids. With irritability and loss of appetite, we use Bai Zhu and Fu Ling to strengthen the spleen and stomach. Due to prolonged diarrhea, the intestinal fluids have been harmed, so we add Ren Shen and Da Zao. If there is cold in the stomach, we use Gan Jiang; if there is heat in the stomach, we use Sheng Jiang. These two can be interchanged based on clinical judgment.\n\nPrescription for Treating Stomach Cancer:\nGe Gen, Chai Hu, Ban Xia, Gan Cao, Bai Zhu, Fu Ling, Ren Shen, Da Zao, Gan Jiang, Sheng Jiang, along with modifications of the Huang Tu Decoction from the \"Jin Kui\" can be used to treat stomach cancer.\n\nWhen prescribing this formula, if adjustments are needed, use Ge Gen at six qian, followed by Chai Hu at five qian, Ban Xia at three qian, Gan Cao at two qian, and Bai Zhu and Fu Ling at five qian each.\n\n--- \n\nThis translation maintains the original meaning and technical precision of the TCM concepts and terminology.",

If there is an abundance of money at home, use more Ren Shen (Panax ginseng). If there is severe diarrhea, using ten pieces of Hong Zao (Jujube) is acceptable. For Gan Jiang (Dried Ginger) and Sheng Jiang (Fresh Ginger), use two qian each depending on the condition.\n\nThis is a very effective formula for treating gastric cancer. Since the patient can no longer tolerate aggressive treatment, wait until their appetite improves and their diet normalizes before introducing some more aggressive medications. If this formula is administered and the patient still cannot take in fluids and continues to have diarrhea, it indicates a critical situation; the vomit and diarrhea will be full of the medicinal flavor, suggesting that the body is no longer accepting the medicine and is expelling everything, which is very dangerous.\n\nAccording to the \"Liu Ju Fang Guang Yi,\" this formula states: \"For hernia, masses, pain invading the heart and chest, hardness below the heart, nausea, vomiting, intestinal rumbling, and diarrhea, all can be treated with this. If there is constipation, also use 'Xiao Kuai Wan' or 'Xian Xiong Wan'.\" (The \"Xiao Kuai Wan\" is another name for \"Nitrate Pill.\" In the \"Qian Jin Fang,\" it states: \"Six liang of nitrate, eight liang of Da Huang (Rhubarb), three liang each of Ren Shen and Gan Cao.\") Nitrate, specifically Mang Niao (Sodium Sulfate), has a strong ability to break down masses. If it is used without adding Ren Shen and Gan Cao, and only Mang Niao is used, the medicine will quickly move to the large intestine. Gan Cao is used to support the middle jiao, while Mang Niao is used to break down cancer cells, allowing the masses to dissolve. Fu Zi (Aconitum carmichaelii) is also a very effective aggressive medicine, and the recently studied Mu Li (Oyster Shell) is also an aggressive medicine.\n\nIn the case of a pulse that is floating and tight, and then subsequently descends, if the illness retreats inward, it results in \"pi\" (a sensation of fullness). Upon palpation, it feels moist, but it is merely \"qi pi.\" \n\nA floating pulse indicates that the illness is at the surface, while a tight pulse indicates cold, meaning there is cold at the surface. According to the principles of treating cold damage, one should first release the exterior before attacking the interior. However, if one attacks the interior first, it causes the illness to retreat inward, resulting in \"pi.\"",

Li Zhong Tang addresses the deficiency of the \"middle jiao,\" but if it has been depleted, it leads to a deficiency in the lower jiao. Therefore, strengthening the middle jiao is ineffective at this point, and the treatment should focus on using Chi Shi Zhi and Yu Yu Liang Tang. \n\nThe principle stated in the \"Shang Han Lun\" and \"Jin Kui\" is that when treating diarrhea, if the prescription does not stop the diarrhea, one should promote urination. The goal is to direct the water from the large and small intestines to the bladder for urination, thereby stopping the diarrhea. Clinically, this approach can be applied to conditions such as cholera and dysentery, where there is vomiting and diarrhea. Promoting urination can help stop the diarrhea, and the best herbs for this purpose are Zhu Ling and Ze Xie, which should be added to the anti-diarrheal formula.\n\nGenerally, when diarrhea is severe, one should first use Chi Shi Zhi and Yu Yu Liang, as these two herbs are astringents and belong to the stone category. Currently, Yu Yu Liang is quite rare, and most of what is available on the market is Chi Shi Zhi. In clinical practice, if diarrhea does not stop, there is no need to use Chi Shi Zhi and Yu Yu Liang Tang, as Yu Yu Liang is not easily obtainable. Instead, one can use Bai Zhu and Chi Shi Zhi. Bai Zhu is typically processed in the pharmacy by frying it with yellow earth, and there is also a method where Bai Zhu is fried together with Chi Shi Zhi. When Bai Zhu is used to strengthen the stomach and spleen, it is usually prepared with \"fried yellow earth,\" while for stopping diarrhea, it is prepared with \"fried Chi Shi Zhi.\" This can be added to Xiao Jian Zhong Tang or Ban Xia Xie Xin Tang to effectively stop the diarrhea.\n\nHow to differentiate symptoms of diarrhea with blood? If blood appears before the stool, this is not due to colitis but rather external hemorrhoids; if blood appears after the stool, this indicates internal hemorrhoids; if blood and stool are mixed, this is indicative of colitis-related diarrhea.\n\nCheng Wu Ji stated: \"The 'Sheng Ji Jing' says: 'If it is slippery, then the qi is lost...'\"",

Therefore, excessive vomiting can lead to blood loss, as the source of nourishment is gone, resulting in the patient feeling restless. This restlessness arises because the heart governs blood; when blood is insufficient, the stomach becomes empty, and the fluids in the stomach are also inadequate. Consequently, the patient experiences 'hardness below the heart', feeling a hardness in the stomach. If pressure on the stomach reveals a hard mass, it indicates retained food; if it feels soft and pliable, it suggests that there is nothing inside, and the stomach wall has adhered together. 'Pain below the ribs, qi rising to the throat' occurs because the vomiting and diarrhea have caused damage; the stomach qi, which should descend, is instead rising.\"",

If the patient does not have exterior heat but only has floating heat within the body, feeling stuffy, with a pulse that is not very floating, and experiences a slight fever that is not severe, what should be done? The solution is to induce a slight sweat to dispel the heat. At this time, Guadi San can be used to induce vomiting, and after expelling water, the patient's skin will produce a little exterior sweat, allowing the floating heat to leave the body. Therefore, Zhang Zhongjing clearly considers the depth and severity of the illness; one must never attack the patient when there is internal deficiency. This is why he states that those who have continuous diarrhea will die, reminding us that patients with internal deficiency should not be attacked. When the patient is very weak and we need to induce sweating, what should we do? A small amount of Guadi San can be used to induce slight sweating, which is the essence of Zhang Zhongjing's teaching.\n\n**Chapter on the Treatment of Yin-Yang Toxicity in Lily and Foxglove Disease**\n\nThis section is quite interesting; thus far, Western medicine has no effective treatment.

When food is appealing, they may also be repulsed by the smell of food. They may feel cold without being cold, feel hot without being hot, have a bitter mouth, and red urine. Various medicines cannot treat this condition; if they do take medicine, it results in severe vomiting and diarrhea. If the patient appears as if possessed, their body is harmonious, and their pulse is weak and rapid.

This condition occurs in many mothers; they often create numerous problems that did not originally exist in the world, such as, \"Which is more important, the daughter-in-law or the mother?\" However, this cannot be spoken aloud, as they know it is wrong, yet they still feel compelled to exhibit many behaviors. When the son comes home, the two of them hold two pairs of slippers, waiting to see which one the son will wear. Over time, this leads to worry, and worry can harm the lungs. Every day, they think about trivial matters. I often say that the problems in the world are inherently simple, but people complicate them. Therefore, many people suffer from neurasthenia and often fall ill, and even after recovering from illness, they still do not feel well. When you give them Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, they may take it but then vomit; no medicine seems to help. If the illness is deeper, after a bowel movement, the patient may experience a headache, but it will gradually improve after sixty days. This indicates a deeper illness because worry can harm the lungs, and the lungs govern the po (魄) and store the po. In our blood, there are two components: one is the po, and the other is the hun (魂). Worry can harm the lungs, making it impossible for the po to exist in the blood. Therefore, \"if there are spirits,\" it means the lung po is not secure. The hun cannot return to the liver; when the liver blood is damaged, a person becomes weak. In a state of deficiency of both lung qi and liver blood, this deficiency is not a true deficiency. If you give them tonics for qi and blood, their body may not accept it, and they may vomit the medicine after taking it, making it impossible to help them. When the hun is not secure, the patient cannot sleep. Our sleep depends on the hun returning to the liver for a person to fall asleep. For those with neurasthenia or hysteria, if the condition is more severe, after a small bowel movement, they may exclaim, \"Wow! My head hurts a lot!\"",

Individuals suffering from neurosis or hysteria, especially in more severe cases, may experience symptoms such as, \"Wow! My head hurts a lot!\" after urinating. Why is this? It is because they lack bodily fluids. This phenomenon is often observed after a major illness. Additionally, there are many women who worry about their children all day long or spend their time gossiping over afternoon tea, lacking a central viewpoint and not knowing what they truly want. Many of these individuals exhibit signs of neurosis.\n\nIn such circumstances, Zhang Zhongjing stated: \"If after sixty days, urination is accompanied by a headache.\" A headache during urination indicates a more severe condition, which may improve in sixty days. If \"during urination the head does not hurt, but there is a sensation of something blowing in the ears, recovery will occur in forty days.\" This sensation indicates a lighter condition. If urination is rapid and accompanied by dizziness, recovery will occur in twenty days. This is what we can observe after a major illness. This syndrome is referred to in Traditional Chinese Medicine as \"Baihe Disease.\" The term \"Baihe\" signifies that there can be a variety of symptoms, or conversely, that there may be no symptoms at all. You might say that a person is not ill, and upon examination at the hospital, they may indeed show no illness; however, they feel unwell throughout their body. If you are the son of such a person, you should seek me as your teacher to learn how to use Baihe Dihuang Decoction, which will help alleviate their condition.\n\nThe Baihe Dihuang syndrome can be categorized into several types. The first type is the pure Baihe syndrome. Another type is when the individual initially presents with Baihe syndrome but has been mistakenly treated with sweating, purging, or vomiting, leading to further differentiation into four formulas. The first is the pure Baihe syndrome. \"Baihe disease does not involve vomiting, purging, or sweating; the condition remains as it initially presented.\"",

One should needle two inches deep. This is an injury to the Taiyang channel.\n\nWhat is meant by 'fujue'? It is a type of walking disorder where the patient has no problem moving forward, but cannot stop; if they do stop, their body sways, and they must quickly take a few steps forward to stabilize themselves. Additionally, when some patients need to turn left, they must first turn around in place before they can continue walking. The feet cannot move freely, which is what 'fujue' refers to. In the literature on physiognomy, this is referred to as 'Yu step.' It is said that Da Yu, while controlling the floods, stood in water for many years, causing cold and dampness to invade the joints, which is the reason for his condition. As a result, Da Yu's walking style changed, and it was previously called 'Yu step,' resembling that of a duck. A duck's feet do not cross over each other, and such individuals are destined for great wealth.\n\n'Fujue' is caused by cold and dampness, with the main symptom being the inability to stop while walking; when they do stop, their body sways. At this time, one can perform acupuncture, specifically at the Chengshan point, where we typically use a long three-inch needle. \n\nWhen a lady wearing high heels accidentally falls down the stairs and injures her coccyx, if she comes to your clinic in the afternoon after injuring herself in the morning, you will notice that there are visible veins between the Weizhong and Chengshan points, indicating that there is blood stasis. At this point, do not use acupuncture; instead, use a bloodletting needle to pierce the surface of the visible veins and let out a little blood, which will suffice.\n\n'In recent times, there are few internal medicine practitioners who can use acupuncture.'

It is possible that by the time you finish preparing the herbs, the condition has already improved, simply because they do not know how to use needles.\n\nPatients often exhibit \"finger and arm twitching.\" For individuals with a body that is \"unstable,\" the prescription of Li Lu Gan Cao Decoction is indicated.\n\nLi Lu Gan Cao Decoction formula:\n[Formula details missing.]\n\nThis describes the symptoms of a psychiatric patient. If someone stands at your door, repeatedly opening and closing it, performing the same action for an hour, it can be quite alarming, appearing as if they are possessed. This is what is referred to as \"finger and arm twitching.\" Repeating a single action continuously indicates a psychiatric condition. In traditional Chinese medicine, the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders is largely attributed to phlegm obstruction and phlegm clouding the mind. Why is it that the arm cannot be controlled? Traditional Chinese medicine believes that phlegm not only obstructs the thoracic cavity but, over time, has permeated into the meridians, muscles, and joints, not just confined to the thoracic cavity; phlegm has infiltrated the limbs. If phlegm were only in the thoracic cavity, it would be straightforward; we could simply expel it or resolve the phlegm.",

          "english_text": "The phlegm has not only settled in the chest cavity but has also permeated into the limbs. If the phlegm were only in the chest, it would be simple; we could just expel it or resolve it. However, since the phlegm is now in the meridians, we can only use the herb Li Lu. Li Lu resembles a long green onion, being longer than an onion. This prescription consists solely of Li Lu and Gan Cao (Licorice), and the elongated, hollow structure of Li Lu indicates that once ingested, the medicine will reach the joints of the limbs and the muscles in the meridians to clear out the phlegm. This is the Li Lu Gan Cao Decoction, and these two herbs are sufficient.\n\nAs for the condition known as \"cramping,\" the person experiences stiffness in the arms and legs, with the pulse moving up and down, slightly wiry. If the cramping extends into the abdomen, it is treated with Ji Shi Bai San (Chicken Droppings Powder).\n\n**Ji Shi Bai San Formula:**\nTake Ji Shi Bai and grind it into a fine powder, then mix it with water and take it warm.\n\nThe term \"cramping\" refers to muscle spasms, where the legs and arms become rigid. This often occurs suddenly when exposed to cold air or when jumping into cold water, which is indicative of the Ji Shi Bai San syndrome. Nowadays, there is no need to take Ji Shi Bai San; why was it used in the past? The treatment philosophy in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is very natural and organic. When chickens eat insects, they sometimes consume softer stones as well. After digesting these stones, the chicken's droppings will contain a bit of yellowish-white material, which is due to the ingestion of stones. The calcareous substances that enter the stomach are ground down and transformed into calcium, which is then excreted. This implies that you need to consume calcium, as a deficiency can lead to cramping and stiffness in the muscles and joints, which aligns with Western medical concepts. Therefore, there is no need to take Ji Shi Bai San now; instead, focus on eating calcium-rich foods.\n\nFor those with Yin Hu (inguinal) hernias, there may be variations in size, with symptoms fluctuating. This condition is treated with Zhu Zi San (Spider Powder).",

If the patient does not have exterior heat but only has floating heat within the body, feeling stuffy, with a pulse that is not very floating, and the patient feels a bit dazed with a slight fever that is not severe, what should be done? The solution is to induce a slight sweat to dissipate the heat. At this time, Guadi Powder can be used to induce vomiting, and after expelling water, the patient's skin will produce a little exterior sweat, allowing the floating heat to leave the body. Therefore, Zhang Zhongjing clearly considers the depth and severity of the illness; one must never attack the patient when there is internal deficiency. This is why he states that those with continuous diarrhea will die, reminding us that patients with internal deficiency should not be attacked. When the patient is very weak and we need to induce sweating, what should we do? We can use a small amount of Guadi Powder to induce slight sweating, which is the essence of Zhang Zhongjing's teaching.\n\n**Chapter on the Treatment of Yin-Yang Toxicity in Lily and Huxi**\n\nThis section is very interesting; so far, Western medicine has no cure for it.

They feel neither cold nor hot, have a bitter mouth, and red urine. No medicine can treat them; if they take medicine, they will have severe vomiting and diarrhea. If they appear as if possessed, their body is harmonious, and their pulse is weak and rapid. If they experience headaches during urination, it will take sixty days to recover; if there is no headache during urination, it will take forty days to recover; if urination is smooth but they feel dizzy, it will take twenty days to recover.\"",

When the son comes home, the two of them hold two pairs of slippers, waiting to see which one the son will wear. Over time, this leads to worry, and worry can harm the lungs.

If the illness is more severe, the patient may experience headaches after urination, but gradually, after about sixty days, they will start to improve. This indicates a deeper illness, as worry can damage the lungs, which govern the po (魄) and store the po. In our blood, there are two components: one is the po, and the other is the hun (魂). Worry can harm the lungs, making it impossible for the po to exist in the blood. Therefore, \"if there are spirits,\" it means the lung po is not secure. The hun cannot return to the liver; when the liver blood is damaged, a person becomes weak. In a state of deficiency of both lung qi and liver blood, this deficiency is not a true deficiency. If you give them tonics for qi and blood, their body may not accept it, and they may vomit the medication after taking it, making it impossible to help them. When the hun is not secure, the patient cannot sleep. Human sleep requires the hun to return to the liver for a person to fall asleep.

Individuals suffering from neurasthenia or hysteria, especially in more severe cases, may experience symptoms such as, \"Wow! My head hurts a lot!\" after urinating. Why is this? It is because they lack bodily fluids. This phenomenon is often observed after a major illness. Additionally, there are many women who worry about their children all day long or spend their time drinking afternoon tea and gossiping about others. They lack a central viewpoint and do not even know what they want. Many of these individuals suffer from neurasthenia.\n\nIn such circumstances, Zhang Zhongjing stated: \"If after sixty days, urination is accompanied by a headache, the condition is more severe, but will improve in sixty days.\" If \"during urination there is no headache, but a sensation of something blowing in the ears, it will improve in forty days,\" indicating a lighter condition. If urination is rapid and accompanied by dizziness, it will improve in twenty days. This is what we can observe after a major illness. This syndrome is referred to in Traditional Chinese Medicine as \"Baihe Bing\" (Lily Disease). The term \"Baihe\" signifies that it can present with various symptoms or, conversely, no symptoms at all. You might say there is no illness, and upon examination at the hospital, there may indeed be no detectable disease; however, the person feels unwell throughout their body. If you are the son of such a person, you should seek me as your teacher to learn how to use Baihe Dihuang Decoction, which will alleviate the condition.\n\nThe Baihe Dihuang syndrome can be categorized into several types. The first type is the pure Baihe syndrome.

          "english_text": "**Chapter Nineteen: Diagnosis and Treatment of Arm Swelling, Cramps, Fox Hernia, and Parasite Diseases**\n\nThe Master said: The condition known as \"fujue\" (趺蹶) refers to a type of walking disorder where the patient can move forward without issue but cannot stop; if they do stop, it feels as if they are about to fall, and they must quickly take a few steps forward to stabilize their body. Some patients, when needing to turn left, must first turn around in place before they can continue walking. The feet cannot move freely, which is what is referred to as \"fujue.\" In the classic texts, this is called \"Yubu\" (禹步). It is said that during the time of Da Yu (大禹), while he was managing the floods, he stood in water for many years, causing cold and dampness to invade the joints, which was the reason for his ailment. As a result, Da Yu's walking style changed, and it was historically referred to as \"Yubu,\" resembling the gait of a duck, whose feet do not cross over each other. Such individuals are destined for great wealth. \"Fujue\" is caused by cold and dampness, with the main symptom being the inability to stop while walking forward; if they do stop, their body sways. At this time, acupuncture can be performed at the Chengshan point (承山穴), where we typically use a long needle of about three inches. \n\nWhen a lady wearing high heels accidentally falls down the stairs and injures her coccyx, if she comes to your clinic in the afternoon after injuring herself in the morning, you will notice that there are visible veins appearing between the Weizhong (委中) and Chengshan (承山) areas, indicating that there is blood stasis. At this point, do not use acupuncture; instead, use a bloodletting needle to pierce the surface of the visible veins and let out a little blood to alleviate the condition. \n\n\"In recent times, few internal medicine practitioners are skilled in acupuncture.\" In the past, practitioners of classical formulas primarily prescribed herbal remedies and rarely used acupuncture. \"I once suffered from pain in my right arm,\" referring to Cao Yingfu, who previously experienced pain from the shoulder to the wrist.

In my view, it is quite simple; just needling the Taiyuan point on the opposite side would resolve it. However, his daughter, Zhao Hua, treated him with a decoction of ginger and other herbs for a month before he recovered. With acupuncture, a single needle would have sufficed. If it is an initial pain, classified as a \"full condition,\" simply needling the Shezhe point on the opposite side of the patient would alleviate the pain immediately, yet they do not use acupuncture. In the past, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners were divided into those who specialized in acupuncture and those who focused on herbal formulas, which often exhausted the patients. Treating shoulder pain with herbal washes for a month is laughable; a single needle at Shezhe would resolve it on the spot.

In traditional Chinese medicine, the diagnosis of mental disorders is largely attributed to phlegm obstruction and phlegm clouding the mind. Why is it that the arm cannot be controlled? Traditional Chinese medicine believes that phlegm not only accumulates in the thoracic cavity but over time, it seeps into the meridians, muscle tissues, and joints, affecting the limbs as well. If phlegm were only in the thoracic cavity, it would be simple; we could just expel it or resolve it.",

If the phlegm were only in the chest, it would be simple; we could just expel it or resolve it. However, since the phlegm is now in the meridians, we can only use the herb Li Lu. Li Lu resembles a scallion, being long and longer than a scallion. This prescription consists solely of Li Lu and Gan Cao (Licorice), and the elongated shape of Li Lu, which is hollow inside, indicates that after ingestion, the medicine will reach the joints of the limbs and the muscles and meridians to clear out the phlegm. This is the Li Lu Gan Cao Decoction, and these two herbs are sufficient.\n\nAs for the condition of \"cramping,\" the person experiences stiffness in the arms and legs, with the pulse moving up and down, slightly wiry. If the cramping enters the abdomen, the remedy is Ji Shi Bai San (Chicken Droppings Powder).\n\nJi Shi Bai San Formula:\nTake Ji Shi Bai and grind it into a powder, then take a small spoonful and mix it with water to take warm.\n\nThe term \"cramping\" refers to muscle spasms, where the legs and arms become rigid. This often occurs suddenly when exposed to cold air or when jumping into cold water, leading to muscle cramps, which is the condition treated by Ji Shi Bai San. Nowadays, there is no need to take Ji Shi Bai San. Why was Ji Shi Bai San used in the past? The treatment philosophy in Traditional Chinese Medicine is very natural and organic. When chickens eat insects, they sometimes also consume softer stones. After digesting these stones, the chicken's droppings will contain a bit of yellowish-white material, which is due to the ingestion of many stones. The calcareous substances consumed are ground in the stomach and transformed into calcium, which is then excreted. This implies that one should consume calcium, as a deficiency in calcium can lead to muscle cramps and stiffness in the joints, which aligns with Western medical concepts. Therefore, there is no need to take Ji Shi Bai San now; instead, one should eat foods rich in calcium.\n\nFor those with Yin Hu (inguinal) hernias, there may be variations in size, with symptoms fluctuating. The remedy is Zhi Zhu San (Spider Powder).",

          "english_text": "Heat is simply diagnosed in this manner. When a patient suddenly experiences \"palpitations,\" it indicates a sudden onset of shortness of breath, which signifies insufficient Qi. Why does this happen? When the body is deficient, the function of the gastrointestinal system must be poor; the spleen cannot generate metal (referring to the lungs), and the fluids in the lungs are supplied by the pancreas and spleen. The spleen absorbs nutrients and then delivers them to the lungs. When the spleen's function is compromised, the patient will experience sudden shortness of breath, indicating a deficiency of Qi, which leads to this condition. Palpitations, in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), are also referred to as \"blood deficiency.\" Therefore, one is Qi deficiency, and the other is blood deficiency. The symptom of palpitations indicates that the heart lacks sufficient strength, which results in palpitations, known in TCM as blood deficiency. The \"floating pulse\" indicates that the outer aspect of the pulse is Qi; when you feel it, you sense the Qi pulse, not the blood pulse. Yang represents Qi, while blood represents Yin. When blood is insufficient, Yang rises to the surface, resulting in a pulse that feels large and floating; in reality, the patient is suffering from blood deficiency.\n\nIn men, a pulse that is weak, deep, and wiry, without signs of cold or heat, accompanied by shortness of breath and urgency, difficulty in urination, a pale complexion, occasional eye closure, and a fullness in the lower abdomen, indicates a condition caused by overexertion.\n\nHere, several symptoms unique to overexertion are presented, and the practitioner categorizes them. If a man has a \"weak, deep, wiry pulse,\" a weak pulse is one where you can feel a slight pulse, but when pressed harder, it disappears; this is called a weak pulse. Alternatively, the pulse may be very deep, only detectable near the bone, and again disappears with firm pressure. Or, the pulse may be thin and resemble a string, which is also a weak pulse. In other words, the weak, deep, and wiry pulses all represent a deficiency of both Qi and blood. The first situation is that the patient does not exhibit signs of cold or heat. When you ask them, \"Do you feel cold? Do you feel hot?\" they respond, \"No.\" \"Shortness of breath and urgency\" means that sometimes the patient feels breathless when moving slightly.",

          "english_text": "There are no cold or heat phenomena. When you ask the patient, \"Do you feel cold? Do you feel hot?\" they respond, \"No.\" \"Shortness of breath and urgency\" indicates that the patient sometimes has difficulty breathing even with slight movement, and they often experience abdominal bloating and pain. \"Difficult urination\" refers to frequent urination with a small volume. \"Pale complexion\" indicates a sallow appearance. The patient often feels dizzy and may also experience \"epistaxis,\" which means they frequently have nosebleeds. Generally speaking, symptoms like difficult urination suggest that there is a problem with kidney function. A pale complexion indicates an issue with spleen function, as the complexion on our face is derived from the function of the spleen and stomach. Nosebleeds indicate a problem with the liver. Why do we discuss these symptoms? The main reason is to inform everyone that when such conditions arise, it indicates that the five organs—liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys—are all deficient. However, when you observe the patient, they may appear quite normal, yet all five organs are simultaneously deficient. This is known as \"labor syndrome,\" as \"this is caused by labor.\" These symptoms arise when there is a simultaneous deficiency in the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys.\n\nIn the case of labor syndrome as a disease, the pulse is floating and large, the hands and feet feel restless, symptoms are severe in spring and summer, and milder in autumn and winter. The deficiency of yin leads to spontaneous heat, and there is soreness and weakness that prevents movement. \n\nFor patients with labor syndrome, when they become ill, the pulse is \"floating and large,\" accompanied by \"restlessness in the hands and feet,\" indicating that both the hands and feet exhibit signs of agitation. \"Severe in spring and summer, milder in autumn and winter\" means that this restlessness worsens during the warmer seasons, while it improves in the colder months. This is primarily because individuals with labor syndrome inherently have a deficiency of yin, which causes yang to rise. During the warmer spring and summer months, the internal deficiency heat interacts with the external heat from the environment, leading to discomfort for the patient. In winter, the situation improves because of the cold outside.",

In winter, this condition tends to improve because the cold outside can restrain the heat. Additionally, individuals with severe labor syndrome may exhibit the phenomenon of \"yin cold essence spontaneously emerging.\"\n\nZhang Zhongjing simply explains that most people suffering from labor syndrome experience heat above and cold below; that is, the area above the navel is hot, while the area below is cold. The navel serves as the boundary between yin and yang. The lower part is characterized by yin cold, which signifies a lack of dynamic energy and a cessation of peristalsis, leading to poor metabolism. Conversely, the upper part is excessively hot and overactive. In a healthy individual, yin is positioned above and yang below, which prevents yang from floating upwards, allowing our dynamic energy to be concealed, referred to as \"latent yang.\" In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), it is not the quantity of yang that matters, but rather its ability to remain latent.\n\nTherefore, if a patient has yang heat above that cannot descend, this heat will rise to the limbs. Meanwhile, the lower jiao becomes a gathering place for yin cold, resulting in \"essence spontaneously emerging.\" At this point, the patient may experience several symptoms. For men, this manifests as nocturnal emissions or dreams of sexual intercourse. Older individuals often experience spontaneous essence leakage due to yang deficiency, which leads to a lack of control, causing essence to leak out involuntarily. This symptom is very distressing, but can be effectively treated with herbal medicine.\n\nFurthermore, the symptom of \"soreness and weakness preventing movement\" arises because the lower jiao is deficient and cold, leading to spontaneous essence leakage. Women do not possess essence, but when this phenomenon occurs in women, it results in excessive vaginal discharge that continuously drips, which can also lead to a depletion of energy. When this occurs, it can affect sleep at night. This is because the kidneys govern the bones.",

The differentiation here describes the symptoms that a patient will exhibit when there is insufficient body fluid in the lungs, so thirst is a key distinguishing symptom; in Yangming syndrome, thirst is always present. The expulsion of turbid phlegm indicates that the mucus in the bronchial tubes is being continuously expelled. \"Constantly shivering with cold, heat causes the blood to stagnate,\" indicates that it is too hot; excessively hot blood can also lead to blood stasis, hence it becomes stagnant. At this time, the virus residing in the lungs will gradually erode some of the alveoli and tissues within the lungs, and when the tissues necrose, they will become purulent. Initially, the sputum is \"like rice porridge,\" meaning that the phlegm expelled resembles white rice porridge. The term \"rice porridge\" refers to a pneumonia patient who spits out phlegm on the ground, and after two or three hours, that phlegm will turn into a large mass of foam because it is filled with viruses. \"When pus forms, death follows,\" means that the expelled phlegm, resembling a blood clot, sinks when dropped into water. If it floats on the surface, it is not toxic; this is a property of the substance. If the phlegm sinks to the bottom of the water, it indicates how severe the toxicity is. If you say, \"Teacher, Zhang Zhongjing said that when pus forms, death follows, so we should not treat it and just wait to see if the patient dies,\" although Zhang Zhongjing said this, he still prescribed treatments. Therefore, everyone now understands that when heat accumulates in the lungs for too long and cannot be completely eliminated, one day it will transform into this condition, which in modern Western medicine is referred to as lung cancer.\n\nShortness of breath, facial edema, shoulder breathing, and a pulse that is floating and large—if untreated, it will worsen, especially with diarrhea.

This fundamentally represents a terminal condition. Why is it considered terminal? The swelling of the face signifies what we refer to as \"Yang deficiency.\" Once Yang is deficient, the Yang energy will rise entirely upwards. If there is no treatment when it reaches the lungs, the Yang energy will surge to the head and face, causing facial swelling. \"Shoulder breathing\" indicates that the patient's respiratory system is failing; the heart and lungs are on the verge of exhaustion, requiring the patient to move their shoulders to take a deep breath, as breathing has become difficult. If at this time the patient's pulse becomes very floating, large, and robust, it signifies that Yang has escaped. When the kinetic energy and spirit of the body are about to leave, these phenomena will appear, indicating an incurable condition. \n\nIf there is \"increased diarrhea,\" with the patient experiencing incontinence of both urine and feces, it indicates that Yin has also become deficient. After Yang deficiency leads to Yin deficiency, this naturally results in a terminal condition. Therefore, when we observe a patient with Yang energy rising, their face flushed, while simultaneously experiencing diarrhea, these are very dangerous symptoms, indicating that the internal organs are no longer receiving nourishment from food or medicine. Why is this considered a certain terminal condition? Because at this point, all kinetic energy is moving upwards, and the patient has lost even the peristalsis of the gastrointestinal tract.

          "english_text": "\"Shortness of breath and dryness\" is referred to as \"lung distension.\" In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), what is termed lung distension clinically corresponds to what Western medicine describes as emphysema. There are many causes of emphysema, such as living near factories, particularly cotton or carpet factories, where there is a lot of cotton fluff, or residing in areas with polluted air, like near coal factories. In the past, many miners developed emphysema due to the unclean air they were exposed to. Additionally, teachers who frequently write on blackboards can inhale chalk dust, which may also lead to emphysema. Here, lung distension is essentially modern emphysema. \n\nThe main symptom of lung distension is a persistent state of inhalation, where the patient is unable to exhale. After inhalation, the patient's lungs can expand but do not contract to expel the air, resulting in a feeling of fullness in that area, making inhalation become very shallow. Zhang Zhongjing provided two prescriptions for treatment: the first is for patients with lung distension who can still lie flat; this is one prescription. If the patient can no longer lie flat, a different prescription is used. Although this is a brief passage, it is written in great detail, and further elaboration will be provided in the section discussing Feng Shui.\n\nLung atrophy, characterized by the expulsion of phlegm without coughing, indicates that the person does not feel thirsty and may experience frequent urination. This occurs because the deficiency above cannot control the downward flow. This condition is associated with cold in the lungs, leading to dizziness and excessive phlegm. The prescription of Gan Cao (Licorice) and Gan Jiang (Dried Ginger) decoction is used to warm the lungs. If the patient feels thirsty after taking the decoction, it indicates a case of diabetes.\n\nGan Cao Gan Jiang Decoction:\n- Licorice: 4 taels (prepared)\n- Dried Ginger: 2 taels (processed)\n\nCrush the above ingredients, add 3 sheng (approximately 9 cups) of water, and boil down to 1 sheng and 5 he (approximately 1.5 cups). Strain and take the warm decoction in divided doses.\n\nNow that you all have an understanding of lung atrophy, it can be simply described as lung deficiency. Lung abscess, on the other hand, represents lung excess. If it is deficiency, it should be tonified; if it is excess, it should be drained. If it is lung atrophy,",

This inward progression occurs because the exterior water has not been treated, allowing it to gradually move inward.\n\nWhen the pulse is found to be deep, it indicates the presence of water, leading to body swelling and heaviness. If the pulse of a water disease patient is palpable, it signifies a critical condition. For all patients with edema, the pulse can only be felt at the edges of the bones. When water is abundant in the body, it compresses the blood vessels beneath, resulting in a low blood pulse, which is a normal manifestation of the disease. \"A palpable pulse indicates death\" means that if the pulse is not deep but rather floating, it signifies a mismatch in pulse symptoms, indicating a critical condition where true yang is about to escape. If the water disease persists for too long without resolution, the entire skin and muscles may necrose, which is a very dangerous symptom. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), a mismatch in pulse symptoms is considered perilous. For instance, if you see a patient who is emaciated and lacks vital energy, yet their pulse is strong, it indicates that the patient is in a dangerous state. Conversely, if a thin and weak patient has a very fine pulse, it indicates a matching pulse symptom, and this condition is not life-threatening. Similarly, in cancer patients who lack strength and cannot eat, if their pulse is rapid (nine to ten beats per breath), this indicates a terminal condition. Some individuals may appear robust and strong, but if their pulse is thin and weak, this also indicates a mismatch in pulse symptoms, suggesting that the person is nearing death without realizing it.\n\nFor patients with water diseases, one characteristic is \"puffy bags under the eyes,\" which refers to the swelling of the eye bags beneath the eyes, exhibiting a somewhat translucent appearance, indicating that the individual suffers from thirst and water retention.

If this person can sweat and urinate, they will not experience edema, and it is not classified as water disease, but rather as thirst. \"If the pulse is deep and absent, there is water, and it can be purged.\" The principle of treating water disease is that above the navel we use sweating methods, while below the navel we use diuretic methods.
