When observing blood in the blood vessels, it is red, but when viewed through a layer of skin, the color of the blood appears yellow. This indicates that the water in the blood has been depleted. What is seen through the skin is the color of the blood, so this type of yellowing is not due to liver or gallbladder disease; do not confuse it. This yellowing is caused by dehydration. In severe cases, when the body loses too much body fluid, the brain does not receive adequate blood for nourishment, which can lead to convulsions. The liver governs the tendons, and the tendons rely on blood for nourishment. Without sufficient blood supply, cramps will occur, leading to spasms that tighten and then release repeatedly. \"Spasm\" refers to the tendons loosening, while \"tightening\" refers to them contracting.\n\n\"If exposed to fire, one reversal still draws the sun, and another reversal hastens the life span.\" If a mistake is made, it can still be corrected; however, if fire is used to roast further, and the water in the blood is completely depleted, it will be fatal.

          "english_text": "If the illness manifests at night, it is considered to arise from Yin; during the day, it is counted as the beginning of the day. Therefore, the day after the onset of the illness is regarded as the first day. It takes a full six days, and by the midnight of the sixth day, the illness will resolve on its own, hence the saying \"healing in six days.\" Regardless of whether it is a Yin or Yang illness, if one catches a cold, under normal circumstances, it will definitely improve in six days. Thus, if one does not take medication for a cold, it will resolve within a week.\n\nThe terms \"Yin\" and \"Yang\" have broad interpretations. When distinguishing between cold and heat, cold is classified as \"Yin\" and heat as \"Yang.\" When differentiating between exterior and interior, the exterior is \"Yang\" and the interior is \"Yin.\" When categorizing organs, the solid organs are \"Yin\" and the hollow organs are \"Yang.\" When dividing by upper and lower, the upper is \"Yang\" and the lower is \"Yin.\" When distinguishing left and right, the left is \"Yang\" and the right is \"Yin.\" When differentiating between Qi and blood, Qi is \"Yang\" and blood is \"Yin.\" When distinguishing between deficiency and excess, deficiency is \"Yin\" and excess is \"Yang.\" Additionally, substances such as bodily secretions, moisture, and plasma are referred to as \"Yin,\" while intangible aspects such as the body's resistance, cellular metabolism, and the natural functions of various organs are referred to as \"Yang.\"\n\nRegarding \"Taiyang disease,\" if there is a headache that resolves on its own after seven days, it is due to the completion of its meridian. If one wishes to induce another cycle, acupuncture at \"Zusanli\" (ST36) on the Foot Yangming meridian can prevent the transmission of the disease.\n\nFor headaches, if they resolve on their own, they will typically improve within a week. If a cold has not improved by the seventh day, it is advisable to see a doctor promptly. In cases of Taiyang disease, it may sometimes transmit to Yangming or Shaoyang, or transition from Yangming to Shaoyang, or from Shaoyang to Yangming; this is not fixed. If Taiyang disease has not yet reached the Foot Yangming meridian, needling the primary point \"Zusanli\" (ST36) will prevent its transmission.",

If there is a Taiyang disease, before it reaches the foot Yangming, if one first needles the primary point of the foot Yangming, \"Zusanli\" (ST36), it will not transmit. Similarly, before it reaches the foot Shaoyang, if one first needles the primary point of the Gallbladder channel, \"Linqi\" (GB41), it will not transmit. If by the sixth day or the seventh day it has not improved, it may have transmitted to Yangming or Shaoyang. If a child has not improved by the seventh day and starts to show nausea and vomiting, it indicates transmission to Shaoyang. Yangming heat corresponds to the Large Intestine channel, as the body fluids have dried up, causing constipation in the Large Intestine. If a child becomes irritable, refuses to eat, throws things around, runs wildly at night, and fidgets with clothes and the bed, it indicates transmission to Yangming. The strong heat of Yangming is actually caused by the turbid qi of the stool rising to the brain.\n\n11. \"In the case of Taiyang disease,\" when it is to be resolved, it is from \"Si\" to \"Wei\" (from the time of the Snake to the time of the Goat).\nBecause the disease is in Yang, after six full days, by noon of the seventh day, it is actually six full days, which is from the time of Si to Wei. At noon, it is resolved. Therefore, when prescribing for a patient with Taiyang disease, if the medicine is taken at nine o'clock in the evening, by ten o'clock, the symptoms will have disappeared, with only a slight dizziness remaining. By the next noon, the spirit will be completely restored, indicating that the illness is fully resolved. If the disease is in Yin, for example, in the case of Shaoyin syndrome, if by midnight the patient starts looking for something to eat, it indicates recovery. If the disease is in Yang, by the next noon, if the appetite opens up and the patient eats vigorously, it indicates recovery.\n\n12. \"In the case of wind stroke,\" if the exterior is resolved but the patient remains unwell, recovery will occur in twelve days.\nIf one contracts a cold or wind stroke, and after taking medicine the exterior symptoms are resolved but the patient still feels unwell, meaning they are lethargic and uncomfortable, and their spirit has not fully recovered, if they do not take medicine, they will recover in twelve days.

This is termed \"elimination from within,\" which indicates impending death.\n\nIn cases of Cold Damage, the exterior symptoms are present: aversion to cold, fear of cold, and generalized soreness in the bones and joints. However, upon palpating the patient's pulse, it is slow, and the pulse pattern does not match the symptoms. Yet, they are treated with Huangqin Decoction to clear the heat.

The person's vital energy (yuanqi), original yang (yuanyang), and spirit are all being depleted, with high-protein substances continuously flowing out, leading to a complete loss of physical strength. If there is \"pain in the throat, it indicates obstruction in the throat,\" meaning that the virus has migrated to the throat, causing pain. If there is \"fever without sweating, the diarrhea must stop,\" it means that the heat cannot dissipate; the heat will descend, and the diarrhea must stop. \"If it does not stop, it will lead to pus and blood,\" indicating that hepatitis-related substances have emerged, causing throat pain. If it does not descend to the throat, the diarrhea will result in pus and blood; \"if there is pus and blood, the throat will not be obstructed.\" Therefore, if there is pus and blood, the throat will not hurt. The inflammatory filtrable virus cannot be eliminated by herbal medicine or the immune system; it must have an outlet. When it exits, it can do so through diarrhea or by moving upwards, and one must find every possible way to expel the filtrable virus.\n\nRegarding \"Shanghan\" (cold damage), if it lasts one to two days, up to four to five days, if there is prior syncope, there must be fever; if there is prior fever followed by syncope, the syncope will be deep and the fever also deep; if the syncope is mild, the fever will also be mild. Syncope should be treated by descending, but if sweating is induced, it will inevitably lead to mouth sores and redness.\n\nThis differentiation corresponds to the previous differentiation. Zhang Zhongjing's intention is that if one enters the Jueyin syndrome and experiences the exterior syndrome of wind-cold, it is crucial to remember that the interior has already become deficient, and the gastrointestinal fluids are insufficient. In a state of insufficient gastrointestinal fluids, one must not induce sweating, as the source of sweat is the fluids from the gastrointestinal tract. Inducing sweat incorrectly can cause sores and redness in the mouth, as it will bring the mucus from the liver to the mouth. When experiencing a cold and fever, sweating can be used for resolution, but in the case of Jueyin syndrome, sweating is not permissible. In Jueyin syndrome, the filtrable virus resides in the liver, causing skin eruptions.",

When experiencing a cold with fever, sweating can be used to resolve it. However, if it is a case of Jueyin syndrome, sweating should not be used. In Jueyin syndrome, filtered viruses reside in the liver, and sweating from the skin is unrelated to the liver; instead, it further damages the fluids of the gastrointestinal tract and harms the immune system.\n\nSection 351: \"In cases of cold damage,\" if there is Jue for five days and heat for five days, if on the sixth day the Jue does not return, the patient will recover on their own. Jue does not last more than five days, and heat lasts for five days, hence it is known that self-recovery is possible.\n\nIf a person is in a coma for five days and has heat for five days, by the sixth day they should feel cold; if the patient does not feel cold, it indicates that the illness is improving, which signifies the restoration of stomach qi, and thus they will not feel cold.\n\nSection 352: Any case of Jue occurs when the yin and yang qi do not connect smoothly, resulting in Jue. Jue is characterized by coldness in the hands and feet.\n\nJue refers to the hands and feet being cold up to the elbows and knees. The disconnection of yin and yang qi indicates an obstruction in blood circulation. When blood circulation is smooth, the person feels warm; when it is obstructed, and the heart weakens, the person may fall into a coma.\n\nSection 353: \"In cases of cold damage,\" the pulse is weak and there is Jue. After seven or eight days, the skin feels cold, and the person is restless, unable to find peace; this is known as concealed Jue, which is different from the Jue caused by parasites.\n\nSection 354: In cases of parasitic Jue, the person often vomits parasites. In the current patient, there is stillness, but they become agitated at times; this indicates parasitic Jue. The parasites ascend and enter the diaphragm, causing agitation, which may stop momentarily. If the person eats and then vomits again, feeling agitated, it is because the parasites sense the smell of food and will likely cause the person to vomit parasites. For parasitic Jue, \"Wumei Pill\" is the main treatment, and it is also indicated for prolonged diarrhea.\n\nThe patient exhibits signs of agitation, with a weak pulse, showing characteristics of Shaoyin and Jueyin. In Shaoyin syndrome, agitation and inability to lie down persist continuously, while in Jueyin syndrome, agitation may fluctuate between being agitated and calm; this is a case of organ Jue, which is different from parasitic Jue. \"In parasitic Jue, the person often vomits parasites,\" indicating that the parasites are expelled from the mouth.\n\n--- \n\nThis translation maintains the technical terminology and concepts of Traditional Chinese Medicine while accurately conveying the original meaning.",

In fact, patients who develop parasitic collapse often have a stomach that is too cold; when the stomach is too cold, it is prone to parasite growth. This is why it is included in the category of Jueyin syndrome. The coldness of the stomach is related to the liver; the liver is the organ responsible for detoxification. The toxins in the body are eliminated by the liver, but if the liver is cold, in TCM terms, the liver's detoxification function is not very strong. When entering the Jueyin syndrome, many viruses can accumulate in the liver, and with the liver's detoxification function not operating normally, it becomes easy for parasites to grow in the stomach. The temperature of the parasites aligns with the human body temperature; when a person eats, the parasites also consume food. When the stomach is cold and not eating, the parasites inside suffer from hunger and cold. When the parasites are hungry, they move upwards, and when they do, the patient's emotions become very agitated. White spots can be seen on the patient's lips, and the patient may also experience abdominal pain. Generally speaking, abdominal pain indicates internal cold. When there is internal cold, Xiao Jianzhong Decoction should be used with a heavy emphasis on Shaoyao, which is twice the amount of Guizhi.

If too much sweat is produced, naturally, the body fluids will be inadequate, leading to reduced urination. \n\nIf purging occurs, there may be a direct gaze and loss of urination. The essence of Zhang Zhongjing's \"Shang Han Lun\" is that when a patient has an exterior syndrome, one must first resolve the exterior before attacking the interior. If too much sweating is induced, it can harm the body fluids; if the interior is attacked too quickly, it can also harm the body fluids. If one attacks the interior without first resolving the exterior, it can result in the complete expulsion of all contents from the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine, leading to a sudden loss of nutrition. The body relies on the food that is continuously being digested to provide energy. If everything is expelled suddenly and the source is lost, the body will lack strength, and the patient may exhibit a vacant stare and involuntary urination. The term \"loss of urination\" here refers not to normal urination but to leakage. \n\nThe liver stores blood and the soul, and it governs the eyes. We have one-fifth of our blood in the liver, and this blood is not fixed but continuously circulates. If the source is suddenly lost, the liver blood will become depleted.

Therefore, it is not advisable to use heat for this purpose. When heated, the patient's skin may appear yellow; this yellowish color is actually the color of the blood.

However, the pulse is floating and rapid; the floating pulse indicates an exterior condition, while the rapid pulse suggests heat. Yet, the patient does not exhibit any symptoms, so we will not concern ourselves with it for now; it is not a problem. \"If it has already been resolved,\" meaning if the condition has been addressed, \"and the pulse is rapid, but there is no bowel movement, it indicates the presence of blood stasis, and the appropriate remedy is Di Dang Tang.\" If the condition has been resolved but the pulse remains large and there are still issues with bowel movements, it indicates blood stasis, and Di Dang Tang should be used. \"If the pulse is rapid, there is no resolution, and the diarrhea does not stop, it must be associated with heat and the presence of pus and blood in the stool.\" If blood appears in the stool, it could be due to hemorrhoids, possibly internal hemorrhoids, especially in women who have given birth without surgery; most cases are internal hemorrhoids. Clinically, there are more women with hemorrhoids than men. Pressing on \"Kong Zui\" or \"Cheng Shan\" will reveal tender points indicating the presence of hemorrhoids. Another cause of pus and blood in the stool is excessive heat in the blood, with insufficient body fluids in the blood. Once the blood becomes too hot, it will deviate from its normal pathways, leading to the rupture of blood vessels, causing blood to enter the bowels. Therefore, when blood appears in the stool, and there is pus and blood, Bai Tou Weng Tang can be used.\n\n273. \"In cases of cold damage,\" after sweating has been induced, the body and eyes turn yellow. This occurs because the cold and dampness inside have not been resolved. It is believed that purging is not appropriate, as one should seek treatment for the cold and dampness. \n\nThe patient originally has a cold damage condition. If it were purely a cold damage, then Ma Huang Tang would suffice to induce sweating. However, the patient has dampness inside. When Ma Huang Tang induces sweating, it only addresses the exterior symptoms, but the internal dampness remains. Dampness is associated with the spleen, which is yellow and represents the earth element; it is also associated with yin. Sweating is derived from the fluids of the gastrointestinal tract, and because sweating mobilizes the internal dampness, the dampness rises, resulting in the yellow appearance. In cases of cold dampness, the formulas \"Zhu Fu Tang\" and \"Wu Ling San\" can be used to dispel cold and dampness. \n\n274. \"In cases of cold damage...\"",

          "english_text": "When dampness arises, one observes a yellowish hue. In cases of cold dampness, the formulas \"Zhu Fu Tang\" (Atractylodes and Prepared Aconite Decoction) and \"Wu Ling San\" (Five-Ingredient Powder with Poria) can be used to dispel cold and dampness.\n\n274. In \"Shang Han\" (Febrile Disease), if after seven to eight days the body appears yellow like the color of an orange, with difficulty in urination and slight abdominal fullness, \"Yin Chen Hao Tang\" (Artemisia Yinchenhao Decoction) is indicated. The yellow hue resembling that of an orange indicates yang jaundice, which signifies heat. Difficulty in urination and slight abdominal fullness suggest that dampness is unable to be discharged and is constricted in the lower abdomen, leading to obstruction and difficulty in urination. When this heat and dampness congeal in the lower jiao (lower energizer), \"Yin Chen Hao Tang\" is used.\n\n275. In \"Shang Han,\" if there is stasis heat within, the body will inevitably turn yellow; \"Zhi Zi Bai Pi Tang\" (Gardenia and Cortex Phellodendri Decoction) is indicated. Huang Bai (Phellodendron) is a herb that can clear heat from the lower jiao. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, heat corresponds to inflammation in Western medicine; for instance, Huang Bai is often used for urethritis. Zhi Zi (Gardenia) can clear heat from the upper jiao (upper energizer), while Huang Qin (Scutellaria), Huang Lian (Coptis), and Gan Cao (Licorice) can clear heat from the middle jiao (middle energizer). Therefore, Zhi Zi Bai Pi Tang is another formula for addressing jaundice, distinct from Yin Chen Hao Tang. The latter addresses dampness that is obstructed in the intestines, which is why it contains Da Huang (Rhubarb). The heat in Zhi Zi Bai Pi Tang is stasis in the San Jiao (three energizers), where heat and stasis are trapped within the lymphatic system, leading to inflammation. Patients requiring Zhi Zi Bai Pi Tang may experience difficulty in urination and abdominal distension, while those needing Yin Chen Hao Tang have stasis heat in the intestines, resulting in difficulty in urination. Thus, these are two formulas for yang jaundice: if the patient is entirely yellow, with a distended abdomen and difficulty in both urination and defecation, Yin Chen Hao Tang is indicated; if urination and defecation are normal and the abdomen is not distended, Zhi Zi Bai Pi Tang is appropriate. Both formulas are relatively cool and are used in cases of heat diseases.\n\nZhi Zi Bai Pi Tang is also often used as an eye wash for red, painful, and inflamed eyes. After preparing Zhi Zi Bai Pi Tang, it is filtered through a sieve for use in washing the eyes. \n\n《類聚方》",

When alcohol reaches the head, Atractylodes can help eliminate dampness from the upper body. The damp-heat in the alcohol is quite strong, and Atractylodes is used to address this; however, dampness needs a pathway for elimination. Alisma itself can promote urination, relying on its diuretic properties to expel dampness, which is then eliminated through urination. Therefore, for those who have consumed too much alcohol and experience gastric prolapse, using Wu Zhu Yu Decoction can help restore the stomach. Each time after drinking, one can use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with an increased amount of Ban Xia, as Ban Xia can stop vomiting, preventing nausea and the urge to vomit. This way, drinking alcohol leads to urination, and if one drinks excessively, Atractylodes and Alisma can be used.\n\nSection 281: If there has been vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, or warming acupuncture, and the \"Chai Hu Decoction syndrome\" has ceased, this indicates a severe illness. One must understand what reversal has occurred in order to apply the appropriate treatment. Originally, it was a Chai Hu Decoction syndrome, but after vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, or warming acupuncture, the syndrome is no longer present. \"This indicates a severe illness; one must understand what reversal has occurred,\" which reflects a misdiagnosis by an incompetent physician, leading to a change in the condition. One should observe the stage of the illness and apply the appropriate treatment.\n\nSection 282: In \"San Yang He Bing\" (Three Yang Combined Disease), the pulse is floating and large, with the upper Guan pulse elevated, yet the patient desires to sleep, and there is sweating when the eyes are closed. In \"San Yang He Bing,\" one should harmonize the Shao Yang. If the patient's pulse is floating, it indicates a Tai Yang syndrome; if the pulse is large, it indicates a Yang Ming syndrome. The upper Guan pulse is elevated, meaning the pulse has moved up, with the right Guan corresponding to the spleen and stomach, and the left Guan corresponding to the gallbladder. If the Guan pulse has jumped to the inch position, it signifies that Yang heat is moving to the upper jiao, likely due to excessive heat in the gallbladder and stomach, causing bile to reverse, leading to a bitter taste in the mouth. This indicates that heat from the stomach and gallbladder is rising, representing the need for Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. Thus, by palpating the pulse, one can understand the progression of the body's condition. \"Yet the patient desires to sleep,\" indicates that the patient's energy has already been significantly depleted during the Tai Yang phase, and upon entering the Shao Yang phase, the gastrointestinal absorption is poor, preventing food from being transformed into blood due to the involvement of the San Jiao.",

Normally, sweating occurs during exercise or after physical activity, but in this case, the patient sweats even while lying down, indicating a continuous loss of body fluids.

Sometimes, it is not necessary to give the patient medication, as the illness may not necessarily progress. Each individual's constitution is different; generally speaking, those who do not take Western medicine for a long time and have a strong immune system will not have the illness enter the Yin stage, because Western medicine can significantly weaken the immune system.\n\nSection 285: \"In cases of cold damage\" for three days, if the pulse in the Shaoyang is weak, it indicates that the illness is about to resolve. Regardless of whether it is Shaoyang or Yangming, when the pulse begins to slow down, it indicates that the illness is on the path to recovery. If the patient's pulse is very normal, and there is nausea with a pulse of four beats per breath, this is a phenomenon of pregnancy; there is no illness present. In a normal person, if the pulse is normal but there are discomfort symptoms, it indicates pregnancy, and one should not casually prescribe medication.\n\nSection 286: When a Shaoyang illness is about to resolve, it occurs from the Yin (寅) to the Chen (辰) hours. This is because the eastern direction corresponds to the Wood element (甲乙寅卯), and since Shaoyang is associated with Wood, the resolution of a Shaoyang illness occurs from the Yin to the Chen hours.\n\nThe above discusses the Shaoyang syndrome.\n\nDifferentiating the Taiyin illness, pulse signs, and treatment methods:\nTaiyin is referred to as \"beginning Yin,\" while Shaoyin is \"within Yin,\" and Jueyin is \"the end of Yin,\" representing the extremity of Yin. When one first enters the Shaoyin stage, it becomes dangerous if it progresses to Jueyin without treatment. Traditional Chinese Medicine aims to prevent the three Yin organs from being affected by pathogenic factors. Initially, it is always Taiyin, so when Zhang Zhongjing prescribed formulas, he considered the issues of Taiyin regardless of whether the illness had progressed to Shaoyin or Jueyin, because the initial onset of illness occurs in the Taiyin stage.\n\nTaiyin corresponds to the spleen. Generally speaking, those whose illness enters the spleen are individuals with a weak stomach. In TCM, the spleen and stomach are interrelated; the spleen and stomach are the foundation of postnatal health. Those who are healthy in the postnatal stage have a strong spleen and stomach.",

This condition is characterized by systemic cold and dampness; to eliminate dampness, we rely on Bai Zhu, which can be used at five qian (a traditional unit of weight). This dosage is suitable for individuals with a larger body type. The dampness must have an outlet, which is facilitated by Fu Ling, allowing it to be expelled through urination. To dispel cold, we use Pao Fu (processed Aconite), at three qian, along with some fresh ginger to harmonize the stomach. Most importantly, we include \"Sheng Fu\" (raw Aconite), one piece, as Pao Fu strengthens the interior Yang and eliminates the interior cold. The cold in the muscles and the Sanjiao oil network is entirely removed by Sheng Fu. After taking this formula, the patient will experience an increase in urination, and the stools will become loose and watery. After three doses, the tongue coating will return to normal, and the appetite will significantly improve. In clinical practice, for patients with uremia, after taking one dose, the uremia index can drop from 180 to 130. Pao Fu warms the middle, while Sheng Fu warms the channels, affecting the blood vessels and nerves. This is the main formula, and in clinical practice, we observe any additional symptoms for adjustments. If the appetite is poor and there is frequent nausea, we can add Ban Xia (Pinellia). This principle can be applied similarly. Some patients with chronic illnesses, after taking the medicine to eliminate cold and dampness, may experience phenomena such as vomiting \"white fluids\" or loose stools, which will improve when the patient begins to feel thirsty.\n\n#FORMULA\n\nZang Jie Decoction:\nChai Hu 5 qian, Bai Zhu 5 qian, Fu Ling 5 qian, Pao Fu 3 qian, Sheng Fu 1 piece.\n\nThis is the main formula; any additional ingredients should be determined based on the clinical situation. \n\n#SECTION",

In cases of \"Shang Han\" (cold damage), if there is vomiting or diarrhea followed by seven to eight days without resolution, with heat accumulation inside, both the exterior and interior are hot, with occasional sweating, aversion to wind, great thirst, and agitation, the tongue is dry, and there is a desire to drink several sheng of water, \"Bai Hu Jia Ren Shen Tang\" (White Tiger Decoction with Ginseng) is indicated.\n\nIn cases of Shang Han, the exterior and sweating methods should be used. However, after vomiting and diarrhea, the stomach's fluids are inevitably harmed, and if there is no improvement after seven to eight days, it results in \"heat accumulation inside, both the exterior and interior are hot.\" There is illness inside and illness outside. Where does the internal heat come from? It arises because the fluids are damaged; the body's heat becomes trapped within the fluids and also within the blood. A portion of the heat, after the fluids are harmed, escapes from the fluids and the blood and rises to the surface, causing internal heat. The first organ to be affected is the lung, which governs the skin and hair. At this time, the patient often feels sweaty, fears the wind, experiences great thirst and agitation. When the upper jiao (the upper burner) is too dry and hot, it is because the fluids are depleted; the upper jiao is like the sky without clouds, with the sun shining directly, making it very hot. This is the pattern of Bai Hu Tang (White Tiger Decoction), as the yang of the chest is elevated, and the heart and lungs have a certain level of moisture. The chest is already very hot, and the heat from the stomach surges upward. The fluids have all been lost, sweated out, resulting in a \"dry tongue.\" When the tongue is extended, there is not a drop of saliva; it can be severe enough that the tongue coating turns upward. \"Desiring to drink several sheng of water\" indicates thirst; even after drinking for a long time, the thirst cannot be quenched because the water that enters the stomach moves downward and cannot be absorbed. The true absorption of water relies on the gastric fluids to resolve it, but if the gastric fluids have been completely vomited out, they are gone.",

          "english_text": "When water enters the stomach, it moves downward and cannot be absorbed because the actual absorption of water relies on gastric juices to break it down. As a result, if the gastric juices are completely depleted, there is no way to convert the water into vapor, and it will continue to move downward, failing to quench thirst. This condition corresponds to the \"Bai Hu Jia Ren Shen Tang\" syndrome.\n\n\"Bai Hu Jia Ren Shen Tang\" is a formula in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for treating diabetes with upper digestive issues, and it is also one of the best remedies for \"heat in the heart.\" It does not matter if there are exterior symptoms; if there is internal heat, particularly when heat is present in the chest, \"Bai Hu Jia Ren Shen Tang\" can be used. The Bai Hu Tang syndrome is characterized by dryness, thirst, and irritability. Therefore, when prescribing Bai Hu Tang to a patient, their external condition may be misdiagnosed as a mental illness due to frequent outbursts of anger. However, TCM recognizes that they are experiencing dryness and thirst, with body fluids depleted, leading to an inability to control emotions. \n\nWhy is ginseng added? Generally, healthy individuals do not need to take ginseng unless there is a deficiency of body fluids. Ginseng is often used in gastroenterology, which is why it is included in the Xie Xin Tang formula. When ginseng is administered, it quickly replenishes the body fluids. After replenishing, Bai Hu Tang can then help to reduce the heat, with gypsum being the most effective for cooling down the heat. \n\nCurrently, there is a situation in diabetes where blood sugar can drop too low, leading to rapid hunger, and patients often need to consume sugar. Bai Hu Tang is also applicable in these cases.\n\nNow, regarding monosodium glutamate (MSG) in food, consuming it leads to persistent thirst and the need to drink water continuously, which also aligns with the Bai Hu Tang syndrome. When MSG is ingested, it directly transforms into the Bai Hu Tang syndrome without passing through any exterior symptoms. This indicates its harmful effects on the human body, which is why we advise against adding MSG to food.",

After six or seven days, if one mistakenly uses 'Huangqin Decoction' to clear the heat, the slow pulse indicates cold. Now, using 'Huangqin Decoction' again to eliminate the heat, the abdomen should feel cold, and the patient should be unable to eat. However, if the patient can eat, this indicates 'elimination from within,' which is a sign of impending death.\n\nIn cases of cold damage, the exterior symptoms are present: aversion to cold, fear of cold, and generalized soreness in the bones and joints. However, upon palpating the patient's pulse, it is slow, and the pulse pattern does not match. If one mistakenly uses Huangqin Decoction to clear the heat, relying on it to eliminate the heat, the slow pulse indicates cold. Now, using Huangqin Decoction again to eliminate the heat, which is a remedy for clearing heat and promoting bowel movements, results in 'the abdomen should feel cold, and the patient should be unable to eat; however, if the patient can eat, this indicates elimination from within.' This suggests that what is observed is true cold masquerading as heat. The assumption that fever and aversion to cold indicate the presence of heat leads to the administration of cold and cooling medicines, which, when applied, further intensifies the internal cold, resulting in 'elimination from within,' meaning that the stomach qi is completely depleted. At this point, one must use a large dose of Si Ni Decoction to rescue the reversal; one cannot ignore the signs of impending death and fail to act.\n\n**Sections Three, Four, Eight:** In cases of 'cold damage,' if there is first a state of syncope followed by fever, diarrhea will surely stop on its own.

If the diarrhea does not stop, and there is 'sudden sweating,' during the state of the Jueyin syndrome, the body fluids have already been damaged. Since the immune system resides within the body fluids, if the body fluids are compromised, and the patient begins to sweat, this indicates a deficiency of the exterior. This is a very dangerous situation. In clinical practice, when observing the patient, if the patient is already very weak but continues to sweat, it signifies that the patient's skin cannot maintain the exterior, and the person's original qi, original yang, and essence are all compromised.\"",

When experiencing a cold with fever, sweating is used to resolve it. However, if it is a case of Jueyin syndrome, sweating should not be used. In Jueyin syndrome, filtered viruses reside in the liver, and sweating from the skin is unrelated to the liver; instead, it further damages the fluids of the gastrointestinal tract and harms the immune system.\n\nSection 351: \"In cases of cold damage,\" if there is Jue (a state of cold) for five days and heat for five days, if on the sixth day the Jue does not return, the patient will recover on their own. Jue does not last more than five days, and heat lasts for five days, hence it is known that self-recovery occurs.\n\nIf a person has been in a coma for five days and has had heat for five days, by the sixth day they should feel cold; however, if the patient does not feel cold, it indicates that the illness is resolving, which signifies that the stomach qi has recovered, and thus they will not feel cold.\n\nSection 352: Any state of Jue occurs when the yin and yang qi are not harmoniously connected, resulting in Jue. Jue is characterized by coldness in the hands and feet.\n\nJue refers to the hands and feet being cold up to the elbows and knees. The disharmony of yin and yang qi indicates an obstruction in blood circulation. When blood circulation is smooth, a person feels warm; when it is obstructed, and the heart is weakened, the person may fall into a coma.\n\nSection 353: \"In cases of cold damage,\" the pulse is weak and there is Jue. After seven or eight days, the skin feels cold, and the person is restless, unable to find peace; this is known as concealed Jue. It is different from the Jue caused by parasites.\n\nSection 354: In cases of parasitic Jue, the person often vomits parasites. In the current patient, there is stillness, but they become agitated at times; this indicates parasitic Jue. The parasites ascend and enter the diaphragm, causing agitation, which may cease momentarily. If the patient eats and then vomits and feels agitated, it is because the parasites sense the smell of food and will likely cause the person to vomit parasites. For parasitic Jue, \"Wumei Pill\" is the main treatment, and it is also indicated for prolonged diarrhea.\n\nThe patient exhibits signs of agitation, with a weak pulse, showing characteristics of Shaoyin and Jueyin. In Shaoyin syndrome, agitation prevents sleep continuously, while in Jueyin syndrome, agitation may come and go; this is a case of organ Jue, which is different from parasitic Jue. \"In cases of parasitic Jue, the person often vomits parasites,\" indicating that the parasites are expelled from the mouth.\n\n--- \n\nThis translation maintains the original meaning and technical precision of the TCM concepts presented in the text.",

          "english_text": "The restlessness can sometimes be present and sometimes absent; this is known as \"Zang Jue\" (organ collapse), which is different from \"Xian Jue\" (worm collapse). \"Xian Jue\" refers to a condition where the person often vomits worms, which are expelled from the mouth. \"In the current patient, there are times of calmness and times of restlessness.\" This indicates \"Xian Jue,\" suggesting that there are worms in the abdomen, leading to such phenomena. \"When the worms ascend and enter the diaphragm, it causes restlessness.\" The upward movement of the worms results in this state of agitation. \"When food is ingested, it leads to vomiting,\" as the worms are attracted to the smell of food and the person is likely to vomit worms. \n\nFor \"Xian Jue,\" the treatment is with Wu Mei Wan (Black Plum Pill), which not only expels worms but is also effective for prolonged diarrhea. In fact, patients who develop \"Xian Jue\" often have a stomach that is too cold. When the stomach is excessively cold, it is prone to the growth of worms. This condition is included in the \"Jue Yin\" syndrome because the coldness of the stomach is related to the liver. The liver is the organ responsible for detoxification; it eliminates toxins from the body. However, if the liver is cold, its detoxification function is not very strong. When entering the \"Jue Yin\" syndrome, many viruses may accumulate in the liver, and with the liver's detoxification function not operating normally, it becomes easy for worms to grow in the stomach.\n\nThe temperature of the worms aligns with the human body temperature. When a person eats, the worms also consume food. If the stomach is cold and not receiving food, the worms inside experience hunger and cold. When the worms are hungry, they tend to move upwards, which causes the patient to feel very restless. White spots can be observed on the patient's lips, and the patient may also experience abdominal pain. Generally speaking, abdominal pain indicates internal cold. In cases of internal cold, Xiao Jian Zhong Tang (Minor Construct the Middle Decoction) should be used with a heavy emphasis on Shao Yao (Peony Root), which is used at double the amount of Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig). In cases of internal cold, the pulse should be deep and tight.",

Normally, the peristalsis of the stomach coincides with the movement of the diaphragm, which the person does not consciously feel.

This indicates a tendency towards \"gallbladder jaundice.\" Even if purged, the abdomen remains distended, and this is primarily due to the slow pulse.\n\nYangming disease is a gastrointestinal issue. A \"slow pulse\" indicates a deficiency in the stomach. If the pulse is rapid, it typically suggests inflammation within or an obstruction in the intestines. If the pulse is rapid, one should inquire about bowel movements. If the response is that there are bowel movements but also diarrhea, it indicates the presence of deficient heat. \"Difficulty in achieving satiety\" means that even a small amount of food leads to a feeling of fullness. \"Slight agitation when full, dizziness, and difficulty in urination\" indicates a tendency towards \"gallbladder jaundice.\" The majority of these symptoms arise from insufficient digestive fluids secreted by the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas, leading to poor digestion in the gastrointestinal tract, which becomes deficient and cold.\n\n\"Slight agitation when full\" suggests that the contents in the stomach cannot be digested; the food remains distended in the stomach, causing a feeling of mild discomfort. Why does dizziness occur? After eating, nutrients are primarily supplied to the brain. If the stomach is deficient and cold, food cannot be digested, and there is no nutrient supply to the head, leading to symptoms of ischemia, hence the dizziness. When the digestive system is not functioning properly, urination will also be abnormal. \"Difficulty in urination\" does not necessarily refer to the volume being too much or too little; it may involve frequent urination with small amounts or just a few drops.

          "english_text": "In general, dampness tends to settle in the lower jiao, causing abdominal fullness. If there is excessive dampness blocking the pathways, urination will naturally decrease. If urination is normal, it indicates that the dampness is being expelled through the channels. The cause of deficiency and cold is due to excessive dampness within. When dampness is too heavy and accumulates internally, the entire body may appear yellow, which is referred to as \"jaundice.\" This is because the digestive system involves the secretions from the liver, spleen, and gallbladder for digestion. If the functions of the liver and spleen are impaired, and since the spleen governs dampness, the dampness will continue to increase. When the functions are poor, it leads to swelling. Although there may be fullness in the lower abdomen, if the dampness is expelled, the fullness should not persist. This abdominal fullness is due to the enlargement of the spleen, with dampness blocked inside. The pulse will become very slow. If such swelling is present, the patient will definitely exhibit jaundice; it can even be said that a patient with jaundice must be suffering from internal dampness.\n\n#SECTION\n\n212. In \"Yangming Disease,\" the treatment should involve promoting sweating, yet there is no sweat, and the body feels as if insects are crawling beneath the skin; this is due to prolonged deficiency.\n\nIn Yangming disease, there should be a lot of sweating, which is not limited to sweating from the head but is systemic sweating. Therefore, if there is systemic sweating without any apparent reason, it indicates Yangming disease; other conditions do not present with such sweating. Now, if there is no sweating, why is that? It is because there is internal deficiency, and the fluids of the gastrointestinal tract are depleted. \"The body feels as if insects are crawling beneath the skin; this is due to prolonged deficiency.\" The fluids in the stomach should first reach the skin and then the exterior, but when fluids are insufficient, sweat may be secreted from the sweat glands but does not escape through the pores, leading to sweat being trapped just beneath the skin, causing itchiness. This type of itchiness prevents the return of the stomach's fluids, so \"Gui Zhi Tang plus Huang Qi\" can be used.\n\nWang Hu stated: \"In cases of Yangming without sweating, it is still advisable to use 'Ge Gen Tang' as the main treatment.\"",

I often say that sometimes, if you place two leaves in front of your eyes, you cannot see Mount Tai. The reason is that Western medicine observes viruses under a microscope and sees many different types of viruses, leading them to think that the way to treat them is to kill the viruses. However, after you kill the first generation of viruses, the next generation becomes stronger, and thus you need to use stronger antibiotics to kill them. This results in a vicious cycle where one day, it will no longer be possible to kill these viruses, and once a patient is infected with such viruses and develops inflammation, it leads to death because there are no medicines left to treat them. \n\nFrom the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), it is believed that the appearance of the virus is not important; what matters is to expel all of it, driving the viruses out regardless of what they are, sweeping them all away. Western medicine is very formalized and lacks spirit. At first glance, they seem correct, but in reality, their treatment makes the condition worse because their methods are incorrect.\n\nFor \"Ge Jian Zhi Yin\" (Phlegm in the diaphragm), the patient experiences wheezing and fullness, has a firm and distended sensation in the chest, a dark complexion, and a pulse that is deep and tight. If this condition persists for several days and the physician's treatment of vomiting and purging does not yield results, \"Mu Fang Ji Tang\" (Siphonophora Decoction) is indicated. If the patient is deficient, they will recover; if they are excess, the condition will relapse after three days.

Additionally, if the patient enjoys drinking cold beverages, consuming cold drinks or food can cause cold dampness to block this area, while hot food does not have this effect. Cold food inside will slow down gastrointestinal peristalsis, leading to obstruction, ultimately causing fluid stagnation in the diaphragm area.

Its symptoms include \"the person experiences shortness of breath and fullness,\" which occurs because there is an inability to properly digest food. As a result, fluids gradually accumulate, and after reaching a certain stage, these fluids begin to seep out, ultimately concentrating in the area of the chest and diaphragm. This is the reason why some phlegm and water-like substances accumulate in the chest and diaphragm region. At this point, if you palpate the patient's stomach area and feel a hard lump, it is referred to as \"heart under pressure\" (心下痞堅). This actually indicates that undigested food has not been eliminated and has formed a hard mass in the stomach. The patient may exhibit a \"dark complexion,\" which signifies that the stomach qi is very weak, and the gastrointestinal system is unable to transport the nutrients from food to the face to produce a healthy glow. In simple terms, nutrients are not being supplied to the face, resulting in a dark appearance. This situation only reflects the accumulation of undigested food in the lower stomach; if it accumulates in the pancreas, the situation becomes even more serious. The patient may present with a \"deep and tight pulse,\" where \"deep\" indicates an internal condition and \"tight\" suggests coldness, while a wiry pulse tends to indicate water retention. \n\nIn the \"Treatise on Cold Damage\" (傷寒論), specifically in the section on the Lesser Yang (少陽篇), when discussing the Xiao Chai Hu Decoction (小柴胡湯), the pulse is described as wiry. The Xiao Chai Hu Decoction includes Ban Xia (半夏) to promote the expulsion of fluids, as Ban Xia is effective in draining water. \"If it persists for several tens of days, and the physician attempts to induce vomiting or purging without success,\" it indicates that the undigested food has remained in this location for too long and has begun to seep into the gastric membrane. When it reaches this severe level, the moisture gradually infiltrates. At this point, using methods like vomiting or purging is already too late; instead, one must resort to the use of Mu Fang Ji Decoction (木防己湯). \"For those with deficiency, recovery is possible; for those with excess, symptoms may recur in three days.

          "english_text": "Deficiency and excess, supplementing the insufficient and reducing the excessive—this is its meaning. The excess is stored accordingly. Following this reasoning, one must understand the concept of \"the superior physician treats the disease before it manifests,\" which is the original intent of Zhang Zhongjing. For example, when there are issues with the liver, we should first strengthen the spleen; this is the most fundamental principle. We do not allow liver disease to continue affecting the spleen, effectively confining the illness to the liver and preventing it from spreading further. This concept, derived from the \"Neijing,\" emphasizes that the highest stage of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is to treat diseases before they manifest, whereas Western medicine focuses on treating existing diseases. \n\nIt is akin to a couple preparing for divorce; when they go to the lawyer's office to sign the papers, this is referred to as \"the disease has already set in.\" In reality, there were many symptoms prior to the divorce that indicated if the situation continued to worsen, they would inevitably face separation. When symptoms are present, the lawyer (representing Western medicine) does not intervene; instead, TCM steps in. \"There are symptoms!\" Therefore, we begin to take action. TCM is based on pattern differentiation and treatment, which is what is meant by treating diseases before they manifest. Waiting until one is already ill to begin treatment is too late!\n\nThe principles of the \"Neijing\" are broader than those of Western medicine, which is limited to localized issues within the organs. However, the \"Xiao Jian Zhong Tang\" is not a universal remedy for liver disease; misapplication of it could lead to significant misjudgment of the condition. Xiao Jian Zhong Tang is only used for its sweet flavor to regulate the spleen and stomach, not for treating liver disease, because \"the liver's essence is inherently sour, and it contains bitter bile.\" The stomach is fundamentally the source of blood production. I mentioned when introducing the \"Shang Han Lun\" that the source of blood is the spleen and stomach. After our intestines and stomach absorb food, \"the fluids of the liver and gallbladder seep into the stomach,\" which contains three elements: the sourness of the liver, the bitterness of the bile, and the sweetness of the spleen.",

          "english_text": "This text discusses the functions of the spleen and stomach in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), particularly in relation to the liver and gallbladder. Here is the translation:\n\nIt is about the spleen and stomach. When our intestines and stomach absorb food, \"the fluids from the liver and gallbladder seep into the stomach.\" Inside the stomach, there are three components: the sourness from the liver, the bitterness from the gallbladder, and the sweetness from the spleen along with the mucus from the pancreas. If it is too cold, and our liver is affected by cold, we will vomit sour substances. Therefore, when experiencing sour vomiting, we use drying methods to stop the vomiting. If a patient vomits sour substances, it indicates that the liver fluids are being expelled, and we treat this with Wu Zhu Yu Decoction. If there is liver heat, then bile will be vomited, resulting in a bitter taste. \"Teacher, why do I wake up in the morning with a bitter mouth?\" This is due to bile rising, which corresponds to the Xiao Chai Hu Decoction syndrome. You are all quite familiar with this now. If the bitterness is severe, we need to increase the dosage of Huang Qin in Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, and also increase the dosage of Ban Xia. Ban Xia can descend the rebellious qi and stop vomiting, meaning that when bile rises, we need to use Ban Xia to bring it down. Thus, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction can harmonize the stomach qi. \"When dampness prevails, the liver and gallbladder are not in harmony.\" One of the most difficult concepts for people to understand in TCM is \"qi.\" What exactly is qi? Western medicine cannot see qi; it only observes the circulatory system, whether it is the lymphatic system or the blood circulation system. Western medicine does not recognize that it is qi that drives these circulatory systems; the driving force is what TCM refers to as qi. If the qi of the liver and gallbladder is not sufficient, it means that the driving force of the liver and gallbladder is inadequate. The liver itself is the largest detoxifying organ in our body, and Western medicine acknowledges this as well. When we consume many substances, if liver function is not normal, the metabolic system will not function well, resulting in an inability to fully perform detoxification. In TCM, this condition is referred to as \"stagnation.\" Qi stagnation occurs in the liver, preventing it from moving properly. Normally, our body circulates blood throughout, along with residual substances...",

          "english_text": "The concept described here refers to a condition known as \"stagnation\" or \"depression\" of Qi, where Qi becomes stagnant in the liver, preventing it from moving properly. Under normal circumstances, our body circulates blood and eliminates residual toxins back to the liver, where they are detoxified before being released into the heart. However, prolonged stagnation of liver Qi can lead to the accumulation of food residues and toxins, which, over time, can generate dampness. Once dampness is produced, patients may experience nausea. In fact, the stomach itself is not the issue; rather, it is the dampness stored in the liver that accumulates and exerts pressure on the stomach, leading to nausea and resulting in the expulsion of excess damp fluids. Sometimes, when patients wake up in the morning and brush their teeth, they may feel nauseous due to excessive internal dampness. Therefore, in general, when patients experience vomiting, it is often due to the presence of dampness within the body. As stated, \"When dampness prevails, the liver and gallbladder become unbalanced, leading to frequent vomiting.\" \n\nWhen dampness accumulates in the body for too long, the internal environment changes, making it very easy for parasites to develop. It is not necessary to consume food with visible pests; even pork left unattended can become infested simply due to excessive dampness. Thus, when our digestive system is not functioning well, food can remain in the body for too long, leading to spoilage and the potential for parasitic growth. \n\nTo nourish the liver, sour flavors are used, while bitter flavors assist in expelling dampness. At this time, Wu Mei Wan (Black Plum Pill) can be utilized. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, there are bitter herbs such as Huang Lian (Coptis) and Huang Qin (Scutellaria), which are all considered cold and cooling, primarily promoting downward movement and drainage. However, Wu Mei Wan, formulated by Zhang Zhongjing, does not rely on bitter and cold properties but instead employs a combination of bitter and warming elements. This is because warmth can transform dampness; only warmth can effectively eliminate dampness. Therefore, Wu Mei Wan contains the sourness of Wu Mei (Black Plum) along with the warming properties of Xi Xin (Asarum), Gan Jiang (Dried Ginger), Shu Jiao (Sichuan Pepper), Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig), and Fu Zi (Aconite).",

Licorice and red dates can generate body fluids and replenish them. Other treatments should be determined based on clinical evidence. Hysteria currently lacks effective medications in Western medicine to treat this hidden dryness.\n\nFor women who vomit saliva, if the physician purges them, it will lead to a sensation of fullness in the heart area. The first step is to treat the vomiting of saliva, for which Xiao Qing Long Tang (Minor Blue Dragon Decoction) is the main prescription. Once the salivation stops, then the treatment for the sensation of fullness can be addressed, for which Xie Xin Tang (Drain the Heart Decoction) is the main prescription.\n\nThe \"vomiting of saliva in women\" is discussed in the \"Inner Canon\" (Nei Jing): \"Saliva is vomited from the mouth when there is cold in the upper jiao.\" When a patient has cold in the upper jiao, they will salivate; at this time, warming herbs should be used, such as Ma Xing Gan Shi Tang (Ephedra, Apricot Kernel, Licorice, and Gypsum Decoction) or Da Jian Zhong Tang (Major Construct the Middle Decoction), employing warming and dispersing methods. However, if a physician mistakenly purges the patient, it can lead to a sensation of fullness in the heart area, as the cold descends and affects the stomach. Therefore, \"the first step is to treat the vomiting of saliva with Xiao Qing Long Tang,\" because the cold in the upper jiao causes salivation, and if the condition is attacked and purged, the cold will penetrate deeper. Thus, Xiao Qing Long Tang is used to disperse it. After taking Xiao Qing Long Tang, if the salivation stops, then the treatment can return to address the sensation of fullness caused by the erroneous purging, using Xie Xin Tang.\n\nIn women's diseases, due to deficiency and accumulation of cold and qi stagnation, the flow of menstrual blood is obstructed, leading to years of cold accumulation at the entrance of the uterus. Cold injures the meridians, causing hardness and stagnation above, resulting in vomiting of saliva and prolonged lung atrophy, leading to physical deterioration.

This sensation can occur after excessive alcohol consumption, where the individual feels the need to vomit for comfort. Sometimes, this feeling is not solely due to alcohol; the description applies here. \n\nIn such situations, there is no need to force vomiting; instead, administering Stomach Chengqi Decoction can help clear everything out.

          "english_text": "The pulse is very weak; the pulse at the wrist (尺脈) governs blood. When a string-like pulse (弦脈) appears, it is referred to as the so-called Yin string. The blood pulse refers to Yin, while the string represents cold, indicating that there is water vapor obstructing it, which is why a string-like pulse can be felt. A weak pulse at the inch position (寸脈) indicates that the lung Qi cannot expand, being constrained in this area due to the presence of cold. When the wrist pulse is very thin and string-like, it signifies the presence of cold water, leading us to conclude that this person must have chest obstruction and pain. \"Therefore, it is attributed to extreme deficiency,\" as this indicates that the patient is in a state of extreme internal deficiency, which causes this phenomenon. \n\nIf there is excess in the thoracic cavity, Traditional Chinese Medicine differentiates between heat excess and cold excess. If it is heat excess, it indicates that something is obstructing inside and has already become inflamed. In this case, Zhang Zhongjing prescribed the formula \"Da Xianxiong Tang\" (大陷胸湯) in the \"Shang Han Lun.\" If it is cold excess blocking inside, he prescribed \"San Wu Xiao Bai San\" (三物小白散). This section discusses \"deficiency\" syndrome, as \"excess\" has already been addressed in the earlier parts of the \"Shang Han Lun.\" \n\nWhy is it \"attributed to extreme deficiency\"? This illness arises from a state of extreme Yang deficiency in the body, as the thoracic cavity governs Yang. We know that the disease is in the upper jiao, which is why there is chest obstruction and pain. The thoracic cavity is where Yang Qi gathers; it should be abundant. Therefore, in a healthy person, the pulse at the inch position should be stronger, while the wrist pulse should be smaller and more subdued; this is the normal condition. When the Qi of the lungs is depleted, we know that lung Qi has weakened, indicating lung deficiency, which means the upper jiao has become cold and deficient. \n\n\"Teacher, how do you know there is cold when it is deficient?\" Because the wrist pulse is string-like, we know that there is cold inside. This first section describes how to use the pulse for diagnosis. \n\nA healthy person without cold or heat, who has insufficient breath to sustain themselves, is considered to have excess. \n\nWhat does \"a healthy person without cold or heat\" mean?

What does \"a person in a normal state has no cold or heat\" mean? It refers to a person who is normal and does not have any particular sensitivity to cold or heat, meaning there are no symptoms of cold or heat. If they suddenly feel as though they cannot breathe and experience \"insufficient respiration,\" it indicates that their breathing is very short. From this point, we can determine that something is obstructing the flow, which indicates an excess condition. This is how we differentiate between deficiency and excess. In the section on chest obstruction, we only introduce treatments for deficiency conditions, without addressing excess conditions.\n\nThe disease of chest obstruction presents with symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, chest and back pain, and shortness of breath. The pulse at the cun position is deep and slow, while the guan position is tight and rapid. The prescription for this condition is Guo Lou Xie Bai Bai Jiu Tang.\n\n**Guo Lou Xie Bai Bai Jiu Tang Recipe:**\n- One piece of ripe Guo Lou (Trichosanthes fruit), crushed\n- Half a jin (approximately 250 grams) of Xie Bai (Allium macrostemon)\n- Seven sheng (approximately 1.4 liters) of white wine\n\nCombine these three ingredients, boil them together, and take two sheng (approximately 400 ml), dividing it into warm doses for consumption.\n\nThis is a very mild prescription. If the patient experiences \"chest and back pain,\" it means that sometimes the chest pain radiates to the back, and sometimes the back pain feels like it penetrates to the front of the chest. However, it is not as intense as heart pain that radiates through the back; it is merely a slight, dull ache. This is caused by the stagnation of Yang Qi in the chest, which is why this is the mildest formula, Guo Lou Xie Bai Bai Jiu Tang. The ripe Guo Lou resembles a loofah; if you cut it horizontally in the middle, it looks similar to a tomato. This is a gourd used in medicine, cut into segments from the middle for use. If we use its root, it is known as Guo Lou Gen, also called Tian Hua Fen. The ripe Guo Lou refers to the use of its fruit in medicine. When you go to the pharmacy to buy it, you might notice: \"Hey? Teacher, this looks like the heart's ventricles and atria.\" When viewed from the front, it appears this way, and there are seeds inside. If you observe it for three days...",

It's like a glass of water that doesn't freeze even when taken to the North Pole—would you dare to drink it? If you did, wouldn't you turn into an atomic bomb? That kind of water is not drinkable; medicines should naturally have worms, which signifies that they are natural products. \n\nBecause it resembles a heart, when there are symptoms like \"coughing, chest, and back pain,\" such as coughing and wheezing, we can use Trichosanthes Fruit (Gua Lou Shi). The function of Trichosanthes Fruit itself is to eliminate phlegm and fluids, and it is very effective in dispelling dampness. It can also open the lungs and relieve the blockage of Yang Qi, as noted in the herbal texts, indicating that it can open the heart and lungs, thus facilitating the Yang Qi in the chest. \n\nWhy do we use Chinese Chives (Xie Bai)? In traditional Chinese medicine, the herbs that have a strong odor, similar to garlic, refer to Chinese Chives. \"Teacher, why do we need this foul smell?\" Because the selection of Chinese herbs must consider the principle of \"similar energies attract.\" Chinese Chives, being foul and turbid, can help expel the damp and cold turbid substances that are stagnant in the middle diaphragm area. The nature of Chinese Chives allows us to eliminate this turbid Qi. After the turbid Qi is expelled by the Chinese Chives, we still need a guiding herb, which is white liquor. In the past, Cao Yingfu used sorghum liquor, which is fine because it is also white liquor; however, the downside is that the alcohol is too strong, resulting in the resolution of chest obstruction but simultaneously harming the liver.

When the blood vessels and veins in the lower jiao cannot fully return to the heart, blood stagnates in the lower jiao and eventually presses against the navel. There is a major vein here that should flow back to the heart, and the most noticeable pulsation occurs here, indicating that the blood wants to return but can only reach the navel, after which it cannot fully ascend, thus it stagnates and begins to pulsate. When you touch it, you can feel the blood vessels pulsating.\n\n\"The pulse is wiry; this is caused by heart injury.\" When our blood vessels are filled with blood, the pulse is robust and vigorous. Now, if the pulse becomes thin and wiry, it indicates blood deficiency and the presence of internal cold. Only those with deficiency and cold will exhibit this; it is a result of heart injury. \n\nIf you want to know if a person is naturally more prone to emotional depression, you don't need to see them in person; you can tell from their photograph. If the eyes and eyebrows are very close together, it indicates a person who is unable to let go of things, and such patients are the most difficult to treat. Their problems cannot be resolved by themselves, yet their minds wander into many unrealistic thoughts about the world.",

Their problems cannot be solved by themselves, yet their minds wander into imagining many issues that do not exist in the world, questions that have no answers. Naturally, thinking about these half-formed ideas cannot lead to solutions. Therefore, I often tell my patients: \"When you come to my clinic, your illness is my concern, not yours. Your responsibility is to take care of your wife and children, do your job well, and manage your home. Daydreaming over there is of no use.\" Patients do not understand medicine; they spend a long time just thinking. If \"thinking\" could cure diseases, then it would certainly be possible to think, but thinking not only fails to help but also increases the burden on the physician. Thus, we often find ourselves treating conditions like splenomegaly, gastric ptosis, kidney disease, or stroke, while the patient still suffers from emotional distress. In the process of treatment, we also need to address their emotional issues, which leads to more complications. Many mothers, wives, and young ladies are like this; when they fall ill, they become anxious, go to see a doctor, and return home still troubled.\n\nRegarding the \"heart death pulse,\" what does a pulse indicate when the heart is about to stop? A pulse that is \"floating yet solid\" means that when you lightly press on the skin's surface, you can feel the pulse beating very hard, as if it is pressing against the skin. This condition indicates a hyperactive pulse, \"like a bean,\" which feels solid as if you are pressing on a bean. If you press harder, it becomes even more frantic, indicating a terminal condition with no hope of recovery; this is the true heart pulse. When you feel the true heart pulse, it is characterized by a strong and hard beat. We have discussed this in the \"Nei Jing.\"",

          "english_text": "This is a condition of no return, known as the true heart pulse. When we detect the true heart pulse, it indicates that the heart itself governs a large and firm pulse. As we have discussed in the \"Nei Jing,\" when we feel a patient’s true heart pulse, it signifies that there is a problem with that organ; detecting this pulse means that the organ has lost its function, and the true heart pulse is essentially a dead pulse.\n\nThe phenomenon of \"evil crying,\" which causes the soul and spirit to be unsettled, is associated with a deficiency of blood and qi. A deficiency in blood and qi pertains to the heart; when the heart qi is deficient, the person will feel fear, close their eyes wanting to sleep, and dream of distant journeys, leading to a scattered spirit and wandering soul. A decline in yin qi results in mania, while a decline in yang qi leads to delirium.\n\nThe term \"evil crying\" refers to a person crying sorrowfully without reason. Why does this phenomenon occur? In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory, it is due to the unsettled state of the soul and spirit. The soul is associated with the liver, while the spirit is associated with the lungs. The liver governs blood, the lungs govern qi, and the heart houses the spirit, which oversees both the soul and the spirit. This is the pathology according to TCM. If both the soul and spirit are unstable, the disease is in the heart, indicating a deficiency in both heart qi and blood. \"Blood and qi deficiency pertains to the heart\" means that the root cause of the unsettled soul and spirit originates from the heart. Our soul and spirit can remain stable primarily because the heart's blood supply to the liver and lungs is sufficient. \n\n\"When the heart qi is deficient, the person feels fear and closes their eyes wanting to sleep,\" indicates that when the spirit is not anchored, fear arises, and the person becomes fearful of everyone they see; for example, a patient with mental illness is described in TCM as having very deficient heart qi. \"Closing the eyes wanting to sleep\" means that the eyes are shut, and the person wishes to sleep, yet they \"dream of distant journeys,\" which is exhausting. They are already fatigued, and now even in their dreams, they must undertake long journeys, making them even more tired.\n\nIn TCM, it is said that \"the spirit cannot govern the soul.\" The soul itself governs stillness; when the soul loses its stillness, it will...",

The 69th entry refers to the sweating induced by Ma Huang Tang, which depletes the chest yang, leading to the sensation of heart palpitations below the heart. The 70th entry refers to excessive sweating from Gui Zhi Tang, which results in the loss of fluids in the gastrointestinal tract, causing insufficient water. This leads to a sensation of pulsation around the navel area, preparing for the onset of \"ben tun\" (a type of abdominal discomfort). \n\nIn Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), heart palpitations below the heart do not indicate that the heart is racing as seen clinically; rather, it refers to the pulsation at the \"Zhong Wan\" area. This occurs because the yang energy above has dried up, causing the fluids to be drawn upwards, leading to a blockage at the \"Zhong Wan\" area. At this time, \"Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang\" (Cinnamon Twig and Licorice Decoction) is used.\n\nIt is important to have a concept of the anatomical relationships: the area around the navel is associated with the spleen, the area above the navel is associated with the kidneys, the area below the navel is associated with the heart, the left side of the navel is associated with the liver, and the right side is associated with the lungs.

This is because excessive sweating has occurred, and Gan Cao replenishes the stomach's fluids. \n\nWhy is only Gui Zhi used and not Bai Shao (White Peony)? Why does palpitations occur? When drinking water, the stomach is very warm, and when water enters the stomach, it vaporizes and becomes steam rather than remaining as water. If the water is stagnant at the \"Zhong Wan\" area, Gui Zhi, being very warm, will cause the water to evaporate and rise. Additionally, the outer membrane of the heart contains many nerves and blood vessels in the diaphragm; within the blood vessels is \"blood,\" and within the nerves...",

          "english_text": "Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig) descends and causes the evaporation of water to rise. Additionally, the outer membrane of the heart contains numerous nerve and blood vessels in the diaphragm and intercostal areas. In the blood vessels, there is \"blood,\" while in the nervous and lymphatic systems, there is \"water.\" When Gui Zhi descends, it strengthens the heart's ejection force, quickly vaporizing the \"water\" that has stagnated beneath the heart. Palpitations occur because the \"water vapor\" that should rise instead is \"water\" itself, and this water is cold, leading to palpitations. At this time, the combination of Gui Zhi and Gan Cao (Licorice) immediately vaporizes the water and sends it to the limbs, alleviating the symptoms. This is very similar to the Xiao Qing Long Tang (Minor Blue Dragon Decoction) syndrome, where there is water vapor beneath the heart, which is always accompanied by cough and wheezing. However, this decoction does not present with cough symptoms, so Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang (Cinnamon Twig and Licorice Decoction) is used for palpitations beneath the heart. This is because excessive Yang Qi leads to Yang deficiency, and palpitations resulting from Yang deficiency are treated with Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang. Gui Zhi can descend the counterflow, which is why it is heavily utilized here. Later, we will also use Gui Zhi Jia Gui Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction with Additional Cinnamon), which also employs the effect of Gui Zhi to descend the counterflow.\n\nIf Gui Zhi and Gan Cao are further combined with Fu Ling (Poria) and Da Zao (Jujube), it enhances the treatment. When sweating occurs, it expels the fluids from the stomach and intestines, causing the water from the lower jiao (lower abdomen) to surge upwards, resulting in \"palpitations beneath the navel.\" The force of the rebellious Qi is strong, and this is all related to water issues. When water is in the lower jiao, it relies on Fu Ling to expel the water and then on Da Zao to replenish the fluids in the stomach and intestines. Therefore, the seventy cases indicate that excessive consumption of Gui Zhi Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction) leads to this phenomenon, which typically does not occur unless there is stagnation of fluids in the lower jiao, where individuals with heavier water vapor tend to experience this.\n\nIn the case of the sixty-nine scenarios, it has been observed that if Ma Huang Tang (Ephedra Decoction) is consumed excessively, it can damage the fluids in the lungs, leading to palpitations beneath the heart.",

The \"internal deficiency\" moves like a galloping horse; this condition is suitable for this formula.\n\nThe Da Qing Long Tang (Major Blue Dragon Decoction) is essentially the Ma Xing Gan Shi Tang (Ephedra, Apricot Kernel, Licorice, and Gypsum Decoction) with the addition of three herbs: cinnamon (Gui), ginger (Jiang), and jujube (Zao). Therefore, Da Qing Long Tang has exterior symptoms, using Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig) and Ma Huang (Ephedra) to release the exterior. Ma Huang is used at six qian (a traditional weight measurement). In addition to clearing internal heat, it also resolves the exterior. The distinction between Ma Xing Gan Shi Tang and Da Qing Long Tang lies in the fact that both treat wheezing due to heat. When asking the patient about their appetite, if their appetite is good, they should take Ma Xing Gan Shi Tang; if their appetite is poor, they should take Da Qing Long Tang, as ginger and jujube are appetite-stimulating herbs. When the medicine is taken, why does sweating occur? It relies on the fluids from the gastrointestinal tract to produce sweat. If the stomach function is impaired, there will still be fluids for sweating; this is how we classify the conditions.\n\nTreatment for wheezing:\n1. Heat Wheezing: This occurs when the patient has excessive sweating, indicating Yang deficiency. The tongue coating is yellow, and when wheezing reaches the hands, it is mostly a deficiency syndrome, indicating that the wheezing has persisted for a long time. For children, use a single needle without retention; the sound of phlegm during breathing is loud. Only needle, no moxibustion, at points \"Gong Sun\" and \"Nei Guan\" (related to the stomach and heart), \"San Li\" and \"Tai Bai\" (Earth generates Metal), \"Lin Qi\" and \"Tai Bai\" (the combination of Jia and Ji transforms into Earth), the frontal point \"Yun Men\" and the back point \"Fei Shu\" (Lung Shu). Generally, patients with wheezing will have poor appetites, so also add \"Zhong Wan.\" The prescription will use variations of Da Qing Long Tang and Ma Xing Gan Shi Tang, depending on the patient's appetite. If the patient enjoys drinking alcohol, use Gui Zhi Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction) with Hou Po (Magnolia Bark) and Xing Ren (Apricot Kernel).\n\n2. Cold Wheezing: The most commonly seen is cold wheezing. Every winter, patients cannot sleep and must sit up to rest. They expel white phlegm. The lung is associated with the time from 3 AM to 5 AM, corresponding to the organs of Yin and Yang.",

          "english_text": "The ten points indicate that excessive sweating from Gui Zhi Tang has depleted the fluids in the gastrointestinal tract. When there is insufficient water, the area around the navel begins to twitch, preparing for the onset of \"Ben Tun\" (a type of abdominal discomfort). In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the sensation of palpitations is not due to the heart being in distress as observed clinically, but rather the \"Zhong Wan\" area is pulsating. This occurs because the Yang energy above has dried up, causing the water to be forcibly drawn upwards, resulting in a blockage at the \"Zhong Wan\" area. At this time, \"Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang\" (Cinnamon Twig and Licorice Decoction) is used.\n\nIt is important to understand that the area around the navel corresponds to different organs: the center of the navel is associated with the spleen, the area above the navel corresponds to the kidneys, the area below the navel relates to the heart, the left side of the navel corresponds to the liver, and the right side corresponds to the lungs. For example, if there are palpitations above the navel, treatment should focus on the kidneys, and similarly for other areas.\n\n#FORMULA\nGui Zhi Gan Cao Tang Recipe:\n- Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig) 4 taels (peeled)\n- Gan Cao (Licorice) 2 taels (roasted)\n\nCombine these two ingredients with 3 sheng (approximately 6 liters) of water, boil down to 1 sheng (approximately 2 liters), strain, and take it in one dose.\n\nIf using 4 qian (approximately 12 grams) of Gui Zhi, then use 2 qian (approximately 6 grams) of Gan Cao, as Gui Zhi is twice the amount of Gan Cao. This is because excessive sweating has occurred, and Gan Cao enters the stomach to replenish its fluids. The reason for using only Gui Zhi and not Bai Shao (White Peony) is related to the palpitations. When drinking water, the stomach is very warm; when water enters the stomach, it vaporizes into gas rather than remaining as liquid. If the water is stagnant at the \"Zhong Wan,\" Gui Zhi, being very warming, will cause the water to evaporate upwards. Additionally, the outer membrane of the heart contains many nerve and blood vessels in the diaphragm; within the blood vessels is \"blood,\" while in the nervous and lymphatic systems is \"water.\" When Gui Zhi is administered, it enhances the heart's pumping force, quickly vaporizing the \"water\" that has stagnated in the heart area. The palpitations occur because what should be \"water vapor\" is instead...",

It refers to a face that appears oily and smooth, without wrinkles. One might wonder, \"Is this person not using any oil? Why does their face look oily?\" This is what is meant by a \"young gentleman's face.\" The pattern of a young gentleman's face is not favorable; it lacks a solid foundation. The term \"thin complexion\" here is unrelated to the young gentleman's face; it indicates a deficiency of qi and blood in the body. \n\n\"Mainly thirsty\" means that the patient feels very thirsty. At this time, regardless of whether the thirst is caused by diabetes or some other condition, as long as the patient experiences thirst, it signifies a deficiency of body fluids. Why does a deficient person feel thirsty? Because the yin within is deficient, leading to an excess of yang. Some patients may be both deficient and hot, but this heat actually arises from the deficiency of yin, not from excess heat. If it were excess heat, we would use Bai Hu Tang (White Tiger Decoction) or Cheng Qi Tang (Purge the Qi Decoction) to attack it. However, the \"thirst due to deficient heat\" is different; if there is nothing to attack, how can we proceed? At this time, the deficient heat generated by the patient can still have a high temperature, which will also evaporate body fluids, causing thirst. \n\nIn such cases, we need to prescribe herbs to tonify the deficiency as well as herbs to clear heat. If we only prescribe herbs to clear excess heat, such as Da Cheng Qi Tang (Major Order the Qi Decoction), the heat may be eliminated, but the deficiency will worsen. Therefore, deficiency syndromes must never be treated with aggressive methods. \n\nIf the patient has excess heat, meaning they have strong and robust heat, and you prescribe herbs to clear deficient heat, such as tonifying herbs, the excess will only become more pronounced. Traditional Chinese Medicine requires the ability to discern yin and yang, exterior and interior, deficiency and excess, cold and heat; it is simply about differentiating symptoms in this way. \n\nSudden onset of \"wheezing and palpitations\" indicates that the patient is experiencing sudden wheezing, which signifies a deficiency of qi.

          "english_text": "Heat is simply diagnosed in this way. When a patient suddenly experiences \"palpitations,\" it indicates a sudden onset of shortness of breath, which signifies insufficient Qi. Why does this happen? When the body is deficient, the function of the gastrointestinal system must be poor; the spleen cannot generate metal (referring to the lungs), and the fluids in the lungs are supplied by the pancreas and spleen. The spleen absorbs nutrients and then delivers them to the lungs. When the spleen's function is compromised, the patient will experience sudden shortness of breath, indicating a deficiency of Qi, which leads to this condition. Palpitations, in TCM, are also referred to as \"blood deficiency.\" Therefore, one is a Qi deficiency, and the other is a blood deficiency. The symptom of palpitations indicates that the heart lacks sufficient strength, which causes the palpitations; in TCM, this is termed blood deficiency. The \"floating pulse\" is because the outer aspect of the pulse is Qi; when you feel it, you are sensing the Qi pulse, not the blood pulse. Yang represents Qi, while blood represents Yin. When blood is insufficient, Yang rises, resulting in a pulse that feels large and floating; in reality, the patient is experiencing blood deficiency.\n\nFor men, a pulse that is weak, deep, and wiry, without signs of cold or heat, accompanied by shortness of breath and difficulty breathing, poor urination, a pale complexion, occasional eye closure, and abdominal fullness, indicates a condition caused by overexertion.\n\nHere, several symptoms unique to overexertion are presented, and the practitioner categorizes them. If a man has a \"weak, deep, and wiry pulse,\" a weak pulse is one where you can feel a slight pulse, but when pressed harder, it disappears; this is called a weak pulse. Alternatively, the pulse may be very deep, only palpable near the bone, and again disappears with heavier pressure. Or, you may feel a very thin pulse, resembling a string; this is also a weak pulse. In other words, the weak, deep, and wiry pulses all represent a deficiency of both Qi and blood. The first situation is that the patient does not exhibit signs of cold or heat. When you ask them, \"Do you feel cold? Do you feel hot?\" they respond, \"No.\" \"Shortness of breath and difficulty breathing\" means that sometimes when the patient moves a little...",

The patient often feels dizzy and may also experience \"epistaxis,\" which is frequent nosebleeds. Generally speaking, symptoms like difficult urination suggest that there is a problem with kidney function. A pale complexion indicates an issue with spleen function, as the complexion on our face is derived from the functioning of the spleen and stomach. Nosebleeds indicate a problem with the liver itself. Why do we discuss these symptoms? The main reason is to inform you that when such conditions arise, it indicates that the person's liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys are all deficient.

This is primarily because individuals with labor syndrome inherently have yin deficiency, which causes yang to rise. During the warmer spring and summer months, the internal deficiency heat interacts with the external heat from the environment, leading to discomfort for the patient. In winter, the situation improves due to the cold outside.",

Asthma typically starts between 3 AM and 5 AM, very punctually. To confirm the patient has cold asthma, in addition to acupuncture, moxibustion can also be applied. The acupuncture points remain the same, focusing on treating deficiency patterns, including \"Fei Shu\" (Lung Back Shu), \"Pi Shu\" (Spleen Back Shu), and \"Wei Shu\" (Stomach Back Shu). Other acupuncture points can also be used, employing the Earth generating Metal method for treatment. During cold asthma, it is essential to add moxibustion, as its effects are rapid. The prescription can be adjusted using Xiao Qing Long Tang.\n\n**69. Excessive Sweating**: If a person experiences excessive sweating and feels a sensation of palpitations in the heart area, they may want to press down on it; \"Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang\" is indicated.\n\n**70. After Sweating**: If a person experiences palpitations below the navel and feels the urge to \"run like a pig,\" \"Fu Ling Gui Zhi Gan Cao Da Zao Tang\" is indicated.\n\nFor the excessive sweating described in section 69, it is definitely Ma Huang Tang. Ma Huang Tang expels all the water from the thoracic cavity through sweating, causing the water below the navel (lower jiao) to surge upwards. When the force of this upward surge is too strong, the patient feels palpitations in the heart area. The phrase \"叉手自冒心\" (crossing hands to press down on the heart) indicates discomfort that makes them want to press down, hence the sensation of palpitations. Pressing down provides some relief.\n\nSections 69 and 70 both pertain to conditions following sweating, but the context of sweating...",

The 69th entry describes a situation after taking Ma Huang Tang, where the chest yang has diminished, leading to the sensation of heart palpitations below the heart. The 70th entry refers to excessive sweating from Gui Zhi Tang, resulting in a depletion of the stomach and intestinal fluids, causing insufficient water, which leads to a twitching sensation around the navel, indicating a preparation for the condition known as \"Ben Tun\" (running piglet syndrome). \n\nIn Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), heart palpitations below the heart do not refer to the heart racing as seen clinically; rather, it indicates a pulsation at the \"Zhong Wan\" area. This occurs because the heavenly yang above has dried up, causing the water to be forcibly drawn upwards, leading to a blockage at the \"Zhong Wan\" area. At this time, \"Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang\" (Cinnamon Twig and Licorice Decoction) is used.\n\nYou should have a concept that the area around the navel is divided as follows: the center of the navel belongs to the spleen, the area above the navel belongs to the kidneys, the area below the navel belongs to the heart, the left side of the navel belongs to the liver, and the right side belongs to the lungs. For example, if there is palpitations above the navel, treatment should focus on the kidneys, and similarly for other areas.\n\nGui Zhi Gan Cao Tang formula:\n- Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig) 4 taels (peeled)\n- Gan Cao (Licorice) 2 taels (roasted)\n\nCombine these two ingredients with 3 sheng (approximately 9 cups) of water, boil down to 1 sheng, strain, and take it in one dose. \n\nIf using 4 qian (approximately 12 grams) of Gui Zhi, then use 2 qian (approximately 6 grams) of Gan Cao, as Gui Zhi is twice the amount of Gan Cao. This is because excessive sweating has occurred, and Gan Cao replenishes the stomach's fluids. \n\nWhy use Gui Zhi and not Bai Shao (White Peony)? Why does palpitations occur? When drinking water, the stomach is very hot; when water enters the stomach, it vaporizes and becomes steam, not just water. If the water is stagnant at the \"Zhong Wan,\" Gui Zhi, being very warming, will help evaporate the water upwards. Additionally, the outer membrane of the heart contains many nerves and blood vessels in the diaphragm; within the blood vessels is \"blood,\" and in the nerves...",

          "english_text": "Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig) descends and causes the evaporation of water to rise. Additionally, the outer membrane of the heart contains numerous nerve and blood vessels within the diaphragm and the vascular system, where \"blood\" is found, while in the nervous and lymphatic systems, there is \"water.\" When Gui Zhi descends, it strengthens the heart's ejection force, rapidly vaporizing the \"water\" that is stagnant beneath the heart. Palpitations occur because the \"water vapor\" that should rise is instead \"water\" that comes up, and this water is cold, leading to palpitations. At this time, the combination of Gui Zhi and Gan Cao (Licorice) immediately vaporizes the water and sends it to the four limbs, alleviating the symptoms. This is very similar to the Xiao Qing Long Tang (Minor Blue Dragon Decoction) syndrome, where there is water vapor beneath the heart, which is always accompanied by cough and wheezing. However, this decoction does not present with cough symptoms, so Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang (Cinnamon Twig and Licorice Decoction) is used for palpitations beneath the heart. This is because excessive yang transformation leads to yang deficiency, and palpitations resulting from yang deficiency are treated with Gui Zhi Gan Cao Tang. Gui Zhi can descend and counteract the rebellious qi, which is why it is heavily utilized here. Later, we will also use Gui Zhi Jia Gui Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction with Additional Cinnamon), which also employs the effect of Gui Zhi to counteract rebellious qi.\n\nIf Gui Zhi and Gan Cao are further combined with Fu Ling (Poria) and Da Zao (Jujube), it enhances the treatment. When sweating is induced, the fluids of the stomach and intestines are expelled, causing the water from the lower jiao (lower abdomen) to surge upwards, resulting in \"palpitations beneath the navel.\" The force of the rebellious qi is strong, and it is all related to water issues. When water is in the lower jiao, it relies on Fu Ling to expel the water and on Da Zao to replenish the fluids of the stomach and intestines. Therefore, the seventy cases indicate that Gui Zhi Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction) was consumed excessively; normally, this phenomenon does not occur. Most cases involve individuals with stagnant fluids in the lower jiao, where water vapor is heavier and accumulates in the lower jiao.\n\nIn the case of the sixty-nine instances, it has been observed that if Ma Huang Tang (Ephedra Decoction) is taken excessively, it can damage the fluids in the lungs, leading to palpitations beneath the heart.",

A person with a strong constitution who develops symptoms of the Ma Huang Decoction may not have taken an adequate dose of the decoction. However, the Ma Huang Decoction has already stimulated the circulation of blood and partially activated the immune system. As a result, the Yang Qi surges upward, and the blood rushes to the head, leading to dizziness and severe blood deviation from the meridians, causing nosebleeds. Sweat and blood share the same origin; sometimes, when a patient is given a sweating remedy, the fever subsides immediately after sweating. At other times, when a patient is given a sweating remedy, the result is a nosebleed, and the fever also subsides. Therefore, when children have a fever and experience a nosebleed, the fever may resolve. Children often have strong Yang Qi, and sometimes when they catch a cold, a nosebleed can lead to the resolution of the fever. At this point, seeing the nosebleed indicates that the patient is recovering, and prescribing the Ma Huang Decoction again would be excessive.\n\nIn clinical practice, there is a case involving two carpenter brothers who, on a hot day, brought their father wrapped in a cotton quilt to the clinic, stating that he had suffered a stroke for a week.

To be cautious, I called the next day to verify, only to find out from the family that he was not at home; he had gone out to have fun. I asked the family how many bowls of the Ma Huang Decoction he had consumed, and they replied that he had only drunk one bowl. The effect of the medicine was that quick, and he still slept very well after taking the Ma Huang Decoction, without experiencing insomnia due to it. Although he had not improved after eight or nine days, regardless of whether the diagnosis was a stroke or a cold, as long as the symptoms still indicated the need for the Ma Huang Decoction, I would continue to use it.

In Taiyang disease, the pulse is floating and tight, there is fever, and the body does not sweat; if there is a nosebleed, the condition improves.\n\nThis is because the individual's physical strength is stronger than before; the Yang Qi was only moderately strong earlier and still requires Ma Huang Tang to expel the cold. In this case, Ma Huang Tang is not needed. It is commonly seen in children, especially boys, who are very active and run around. While the mother is still preparing Ma Huang Tang, the child experiences a nosebleed and then recovers. Therefore, there is no need to be overly anxious; the bleeding will stop on its own. This phenomenon generally occurs in children under the age of fourteen, as they possess a pure Yang constitution. This has been discussed in acupuncture courses: if a child under fourteen experiences a nosebleed, treatment is not necessary.\n\nThe body's temperature may decrease due to the loss of blood, hence in Traditional Chinese Medicine, this is referred to as \"red sweat.\" Therefore, individuals with a tendency to bleed easily, such as those with cerebral congestion, are not only unharmed but may actually benefit from it. As stated in the \"Inner Canon\": \"Those who lose blood do not sweat; those who lose sweat do not bleed.\" This means that individuals who frequently experience nosebleeds do not sweat, while those who sweat a lot do not tend to have nosebleeds. \n\n#SECTION",

If the sweat does not flow out completely, it then transitions to \"Yangming.\" If there is still slight sweating and no aversion to cold, it indicates that the \"Taiyang\" disease has not resolved. In this case, purging is contraindicated, as it would be counterproductive; thus, a mild sweating method may be employed. If the complexion is bright red, it indicates that Yang Qi is constrained on the surface, and it should be resolved and diffused. If sweating is insufficient and does not flow out completely, Yang Qi is unable to escape. In such cases, whether sweating occurs or not, the person may feel restless and unable to pinpoint the pain, which may shift between the abdomen and the limbs. Upon palpation, the pain cannot be located, and the person may experience shortness of breath, preferring to sit due to the incomplete sweating. Further sweating may lead to improvement. How do we know that the sweating is incomplete? The pulse is thin, which indicates this.\n\n\"Two Yang diseases occurring together\" refers to the simultaneous presence of Taiyang and Yangming diseases. \"When Taiyang disease first manifests, sweating is induced.\" At the onset of Taiyang disease, if the patient's sweat is fully released, the condition improves. However, if the sweating is not thorough, \"the sweat first appears but does not flow out completely.\" When prescribing, if the dosage is too small due to a soft-hearted approach, the pathogenic factors remain, and as time passes, the heat pathogen of the Taiyang syndrome transitions to the Yangming syndrome. \"There continues to be slight sweating and no aversion to cold,\" indicating that in Yangming syndrome, sweating may still occur because the fluids of the intestines continue to flow outward. However, Yangming syndrome does not present with cold symptoms, only heat symptoms, and the exterior symptoms have already resolved, moving inward. In this situation, \"if the Taiyang disease has not resolved, purging is contraindicated.\" One must first assess whether the patient is in the Yangming or Taiyang stage by asking if they still have an aversion to wind. If the answer is yes, inquire if they have an aversion to cold. If they respond affirmatively and indicate they are still sweating, it suggests that the exterior syndrome has not yet resolved.",

          "english_text": "is different. We also use the method of inducing sweating, and Zhang Zhongjing specifically emphasizes that inducing sweating requires great skill. If you induce too much sweat, the wind will escape, but the dampness will remain, because the patient is not only suffering from wind symptoms. \"If the wind is expelled but the dampness remains,\" then recovery will not occur. \"If treating wind-dampness, and the patient feels as if they are about to sweat, both wind and dampness will be expelled.\" This patient feels as if they are about to break into a heavy sweat, but upon examination, you find that they have only produced a thin layer of sweat; this is the proper way to induce sweating. Therefore, the dosage of the prescription must be carefully controlled. This is a standard principle in TCM for treating wind-dampness. \n\nIn the past, everyone learned from the \"Shang Han Lun,\" which discusses purely exterior wind. Guizhi Decoction is used to dispel wind. How should we handle patients with wind-dampness? Later, we will differentiate several conditions and use different prescriptions accordingly. Why do we need to differentiate the prescriptions? Because dampness manifests in different locations, we must use different prescriptions.\n\nFor those with dampness, they experience body aches, fever, a yellow complexion, shortness of breath, headaches, nasal congestion, and irritability. Their pulse is large, they can still eat and drink, and their abdomen is harmonious with no disease; the illness is due to cold dampness in the head, hence the nasal congestion. Internal medicine for the nose will resolve this.\n\n\"For those with dampness, they experience body aches, fever, a yellow complexion, shortness of breath, headaches, nasal congestion, and irritability.\" How do we initially determine that this patient belongs to the damp category? It’s simple: \"Stick out your tongue for me to see.\" Upon examination, if the person's tongue is yellow, thick, and the coating is sticky and thick, with a lot of sticky saliva in the mouth, this indicates they belong to the damp category. If the patient has \"a yellow complexion and shortness of breath, headaches, nasal congestion, and irritability, with a large pulse and the ability to eat and drink, and their abdomen is harmonious with no disease,\" this ability to eat and drink indicates that the middle jiao is harmonious.",

Dampness in this area can lead to nasal congestion. Due to the sticky nature of dampness, it can block the nose, causing the patient to wheeze and struggle to breathe, resorting to mouth breathing. In this situation, we recognize that dampness is present in the nose, similar to what Western medicine refers to as sinusitis or nasal purulence, among other terms. \n\n\"Internal medicine will cure the nose.\" According to Zhong Shi, at this time, the medicine should be applied directly into the nose for the best effect. Since the dampness is only accumulated in the nose, we only need to address the dampness there. If the medicine is taken orally, it will go to the stomach, which will delay treatment significantly compared to directly spraying the medicine into the nose. Therefore, when treating sinusitis, in addition to acupuncture, we generally do not need to use oral prescriptions but should use a nasal spray.\n\nIf we use acupuncture, we can select the Yingxiang point. If there is purulent discharge from the nose, with a lot of nasal mucus, we can perform moxibustion on the Shangxing point, which is also a major point for nasal conditions. The Baihui and Qianting points can also be used to treat nasal diseases. Points on the back, such as Fengchi and Feishu, can also treat nasal conditions, as the lungs open to the nose.\n\nWhen you needle the Yingxiang points, if the nasal congestion does not clear immediately, it indicates that you have not successfully targeted the Yingxiang point. Therefore, if you insert the needle and do not feel any sensation, do not doubt the acupuncture technique; rather, it may be that your technique needs improvement.",

Zhang Zhongjing mentioned, \"In cases of dampness, with body discomfort and pain, Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang can be used to induce sweating.\" This is because the patient already has dampness internally; typically, after sweating, the dampness can be resolved. When dampness is inside the body, there are usually no noticeable symptoms. However, once the Ma Huang Tang syndrome is present, the cold constricts the exterior, leading to pain. The reason is that the dampness in the body cannot disperse through the skin's surface. This dampness originates from the lungs and reaches the skin's surface. When the skin surface is affected by cold, it is essential to open the patient's pores to expel the cold, which must rely on Ma Huang Tang. Once Ma Huang Tang is administered, it will induce sweating. However, if the patient has significant dampness, as mentioned by Zhang Zhongjing, sweating in cases of dampness may allow the wind to escape but not the dampness, correct? Therefore, it is necessary to add Bai Zhu (Atractylodes) to the formula. Bai Zhu is effective in dispelling dampness, while Ma Huang Tang is used to expel exterior cold. If there is internal cold-dampness, this medication should not be relied upon, allowing everyone to differentiate accordingly. Thus, if it is determined that the patient has exterior cold-dampness, there will definitely be a lack of sweating. When the patient already exhibits Ma Huang Tang syndrome, we know that sweating is required. However, if you encounter a patient with Ma Huang Tang syndrome who experiences widespread joint pain and you also notice significant dampness, you should not simply prescribe Ma Huang Tang; you must add Bai Zhu to the formula. \n\nMa Huang Jia Zhu Tang is also indicated in cases of jaundice, when the skin appears yellow. When there is yellowing, dark yellow, or sallow yellow, we also use Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang. Why is this? Because the damp-heat in the lungs is inherent to our body. When dampness resides in the upper jiao (the lungs), the lungs themselves are the area where heat is dissipated. When...",

Sometimes, the stool may come out resembling a long whip, which is also characteristic of Yangming syndrome. In the large intestine, hard stool can cause a blockage, making the intestinal walls narrow, resulting in thin and elongated stools. There can be a situation where the stool is stuck at the corner of the small intestine, resembling sheep droppings, and coming out like Liuwei Dihuang Wan (Six-Ingredient Rehmannia Pill).\n\nLogically, \"if urination is normal, but the stool is hard, and there is instead diarrhea with a harmonious pulse,\" it should indicate that there is no stool, yet there is diarrhea, which suggests a mistake in previous medical treatment. \"If there is spontaneous diarrhea, the pulse is weak and should be in a state of collapse.\" If there is a chronic deficiency leading to clear diarrhea, and the patient shows signs of slight stupor with a very weak pulse and cold extremities, this indicates a condition of deficiency-cold.

Zhang Zhongjing stated that after drinking Chengqi Decoction, the patient will feel thirsty, and drinking some water will resolve this. This passage explains that although it is clearly observed that the patient has diarrhea, one might mistakenly think that there is no blockage inside. In reality, the patient experiences diarrhea due to an internal blockage, as it is too solidly obstructed.\n\nIn cases of febrile disease, when the intestines are dry and bowel movements are difficult, it is often resolved with decoctions. The stimulation and propulsion from the medicinal substances can indeed facilitate bowel movements, and water also aids in this process; for instance, drinking plenty of plain water can help with bowel movements. However, if pills are used, especially those made from pungent and hot ingredients, they only possess the power to stimulate intestinal peristalsis without the ability to moisten the intestinal walls. Therefore, the resulting excretion often contains a lot of residual moisture, which is why Western medications or glycerin tablets cannot induce the production of body fluids in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n#SECTION\n\n119. \"Taiyang disease\" that does not resolve, with heat binding the bladder, the person appears delirious, and blood flows downward; those who have this condition will improve.

When Gui Zhi Decoction, Ge Gen Decoction, or Ma Huang Decoction fail to release the exterior, the pathogen directly enters the interior through the meridians, penetrating the bladder from the surface of the skin. The bladder is located at the front of the abdomen, with the Jing Gong (reproductive palace) in the middle and the large intestine at the back. Normally, the water that is expelled in urination is vaporized; during vaporization, part of the water moves into the gallbladder, where water generates wood and transforms into bile. The process of vaporization is inherently hot, and when this heat enters the bladder, it transfers heat to the bladder along the Taiyang bladder meridian. If the heat becomes excessive, it can cause blood vessels to rupture, leading to urination issues.\n\n--- \n\nThis translation maintains the technical precision and medical terminology of the original text.",

If the heat continues to accumulate, it can become excessively hot, causing blood vessels to rupture, leading to hematuria (blood in urine). This is a manifestation of an external condition that has not been resolved and has penetrated internally. Another scenario involves trauma, such as being kicked or injured during exercise, which can obstruct urination, resulting in internal blood stasis. This is also considered an external injury, and the treatment for this is the Peach Pit Decoction (Tao He Cheng Qi Tang). \n\nHeat accumulation in the bladder manifests as excessively hot urine with blood. The Peach Pit Decoction is the primary formula for treating blood-related conditions and is a relatively simple prescription. The phrase \"the person appears manic\" does not imply actual madness but rather indicates a state of emotional agitation and restlessness. If the person were truly mad, the Peach Pit Decoction would be too late to administer, so this describes a state close to mania but not fully reached. \n\n\"Blood flows downward; if it flows out, it is better.\" If at this moment, the urine naturally contains blood, it is not a concern, as the blood has been released. \"If the exterior condition is unresolved, it is not yet appropriate to attack; one should first resolve the exterior.\" To resolve the exterior, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction (Xiao Chai Hu Tang) is used, as it must pass through the middle Jiao when addressing issues related to the \"fu\" organs. \n\nOnce the exterior is resolved, but there is still urgent distension in the lower abdomen, which refers to the \"Zhong Ji\" and \"Guan Yuan\" areas being very tight, the patient experiences significant pain and discomfort, and urination is obstructed.

The first is when there is pain in the lower abdomen and frequent urination; the second is when the abdomen is not distended, yet the person feels fullness. For urgent cases, use decoction; for less urgent cases, use pills.\" Difficulty in urination indicates blood stasis in the bladder, which corresponds to the Peach Kernel Chengqi Decoction. Frequent urination corresponds to the Didao Decoction. Additionally, if the abdomen feels soft to the touch and the patient feels discomfort in the abdomen, this is also a blood condition. For urgent cases, use decoctions; for less urgent cases, use pills. Generally speaking, if the condition is superficial, the pain will be very acute; if the condition is deeper, the pain will be less urgent. Therefore, pills are used. Why use pills? Pills are characterized by their \"gentle and focused medicinal power.\" For \"acute conditions,\" it is necessary to expel quickly, hence the use of decoctions. Decoctions are for cleansing; for gastrointestinal issues, powdered medicines are preferable.\n\nThe \"Fang Yu Nao\" states: \"In cases of upper syndrome, those with body deficiency are often afflicted. A person with body deficiency may have blood stasis in the lower abdomen, but it should not be attacked. However, if not attacked, the illness will not resolve. Well said! Chen Ziming modified this formula by removing 'rhubarb' and adding 'rehmannia,' naming it 'Tongjing Wan.' This slight modification effectively balances the attacking and tonifying properties, which is beyond the strategies of Sun Wu's military tactics. I have often used these four ingredients, decocted in water, to treat 'dry blood labor' with great efficacy.\" \"Dry blood labor\" refers to blood that has dried up in the abdominal cavity. The patient's external symptoms include \"skin peeling,\" which is often seen in girls, particularly on the legs and abdomen, and occurs every winter when the skin sheds.",

This manifests as shedding skin on the legs and abdomen during winter, where the skin becomes dry and resembles snake skin, while in summer, it appears normal. This condition is essentially \"dry blood deficiency.\"\n\n139. \"Taiyang disease\" presents with jaundice, a deep and tight pulse, hardness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, indicating a lack of blood. If urination is smooth, the person may appear manic, which is a sign of blood stasis; \"Dingdang Decoction\" is indicated for this condition.\n\nThis can be further divided into two categories: one with smooth urination and one with difficulty in urination, to differentiate between blood presence and absence. If there is no blood, the patient exhibits jaundice, a deep and tight pulse, hardness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, indicating a lack of blood. In such cases, \"Yinchenhao Decoction\" will be used. Yinchenhao Decoction specifically targets heat in the bladder. When heat burns below, after the bladder's qi is transformed, some unhealthy urine is expelled while some good fluid enters the gallbladder, secreting bile to aid digestion. Bile is yellow; if there is excessive heat in the bladder, the secretion of bile becomes too heated, leading to jaundice in the patient. One should not underestimate blood stasis; it may not be visible on X-rays, yet it can lead to manic behavior. This stasis can sometimes affect the brain. Depending on the situation, one might use \"Dachengqi Decoction\" or \"Dingdang Decoction,\" so it is essential to observe the urination patterns. If urination is smooth, \"Dingdang Decoction\" is appropriate; if the urine is very yellow, it indicates excessive heat in the lower jiao, and if there is constipation, \"Dachengqi Decoction\" should be used to purge.\n\n140. In \"Shanghan\" (cold damage), if there is heat, fullness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, but the urination is now normal, it indicates the presence of blood. In this case, one should purge immediately without leaving any medication behind, and \"Dingdang Pill\" is recommended. \n\nHeat accumulation in the bladder should typically result in difficulty urinating; however, if urination is normal, and the patient reports pain in the lower abdomen around the \"Zhongji\" and \"Guanyuan\" areas, the pain arises from obstruction. If urination is good, it indicates that blood is blocked.",

          "english_text": "The patient initially experienced difficulty urinating, but now their urination is normal. The patient reports significant pain in the lower abdomen, particularly around the \"Zhongji\" and \"Guanyuan\" areas. The pain is associated with obstruction; however, urination is good, indicating that blood is blocked. The difficulty in urination may be due to kidney stones, and the use of Wuling San (Five-Ingredient Powder) could help resolve this. Currently, the patient is experiencing considerable pain, but upon palpation, the abdomen feels soft, suggesting that there is stagnant blood inside. To diagnose whether there is blood stagnation, we assess the urination; if it is not smooth, we note that \"no excess medicine should be used, and it is advisable to use Diding Wan.\" Other medications are ineffective; it is essential to use Diding Wan. The symptoms appear milder compared to those treated with Diding Decoction, and the dosage is the same. Although the symptoms seem lighter, the underlying condition is more severe.\n\n**Diding Wan Formula:**\n- 20 pieces of leeches (boiled)\n- 25 pieces of fly larvae (boiled, wings removed)\n- 20 pieces of peach kernels (peeled and pointed ends removed)\n- 3 taels of rhubarb (soaked in wine)\n\nCombine these four ingredients, grind them into a powder, and form into four pills. Use one pill with one liter of water, boil it down to seven cups, and take this amount. If blood is not expelled, take another dose. \n\nPeach kernels are very sticky, and crushed leeches are also sticky, so divide the mixture into four pills. Generally, 20 leeches weigh about 2 qian, 25 fly larvae are approximately 2.5 qian, 20 peach kernels weigh 2 qian, and 3 qian of rhubarb is used. \"Zhui\" refers to the time after taking the medicine today, which is at least 24 hours; if blood is expelled, no further doses are needed. If blood is expelled, there is no need to continue taking the medicine; one pill at a time is sufficient. The amount of stagnant blood varies among individuals, but the prescription remains the same, though the dosage may differ. Stop taking the medicine once the desired effect is achieved.\n\nAccording to the \"Liuju Fang Guangyi,\" this formula states: \"In my family, we use this formula, taking the four ingredients to make a powder and refining it with honey into pills.\" Using raw honey will enhance the effect. It also states: \"If it forms into lumps, it is suitable for chronic patients; although they may have taken medicine regularly, it is still difficult to achieve results.\"",

          "english_text": "In the case of blood's original color, the reason is due to insufficient fluids; at this time, eating water pears is best. \"When Yang is excessive, there is a desire to have a nosebleed.\" Yang energy rises; if the patient experiences a nosebleed, the heat within the blood will disperse, leading to improvement. If the patient has \"Yin deficiency with difficulty urinating,\" it is because the body lacks fluids. \"When both Yin and Yang are exhausted, the body becomes dry.\" If the patient suffers from both Yin and Yang deficiency, the body will become dry and emaciated. However, why does sweating occur only on the head? The body may not sweat at all, yet the head is sweating profusely; this is referred to in TCM as \"floating Yang.\" Floating Yang relates to the immune system and the function of the gastrointestinal tract, as well as the heat within the gastrointestinal system. Under normal circumstances, Yin and Yang intersect. Why can Yang heat remain in the middle jiao without dispersing? This is because a person possesses both Yin and Yang, as well as fluids, existing in a certain ratio, allowing it to remain in the middle jiao. If one day the fluids decrease, the reason for the decrease may be due to being attacked or scorched by fire. When fluids are insufficient, the Yang heat in the stomach rushes to the head, causing sweating. In Chinese medicine, to bring down floating Yang, the best remedy is the shell of the oyster, which can gather floating Yang. According to the classic texts, a person with a \"steamer head\" can only serve as a school official and cannot become a military officer, as this person is too impatient. \n\nIn another scenario, Yangming heat can also easily cause sweating on the head, which is different from the previous case where sweating occurs only on the head due to both Yin and Yang being deficient. \"Abdominal fullness\" indicates that the stool inside has become dry. \"Slight wheezing, dry mouth, and sore throat\" suggest that the throat has become ulcerated. \"Or no bowel movement; if prolonged, it leads to delirium, and in severe cases, to hiccups.\" When hiccups occur, it indicates that the stomach Qi is exhausted, which is very dangerous. If this continues, \"the hands and feet become restless, fidgeting with clothes and touching the bed. If there is slight urination...\"",

          "english_text": "When experiencing hiccups, one feels even more deficient. The occurrence of hiccups indicates that the stomach qi has been completely depleted, which is very dangerous. If there are symptoms of \"hands and feet being restless, fidgeting with clothes and touching the bed,\" it means that the stool is completely dry in the intestines. If urination is still smooth, it indicates that the original yang is still present, as urination is a manifestation of qi transformation, suggesting that body fluids are still available. However, if urination has ceased, it is indeed very dangerous.\n\nFor example, in the case of a child with a cold presenting with a Ma Huang Decoction pattern, if one dose causes excessive sweating and the fever subsides, it may shift to a Bai Hu Decoction pattern. If misdiagnosed and the child continues to have a fever, administering Da Qing Long Decoction may occur. The child continues to sweat, indicating a Tai Yang exterior syndrome, which can quickly transform into a Yang Ming dryness pattern. The act of fidgeting and touching the bed signifies that body fluids are depleted. In the case of Yang Ming dryness-heat syndrome, it is difficult to accurately feel the pulse of a child, as their pulse is normally very rapid. If the abdomen is tender and the child resists pressure, it indicates that stool is obstructed inside. Should one consider Da Cheng Qi Decoction or Bai Hu Decoction for Yang Ming syndrome? Ultimately, due to the resistance to pressure, Da Cheng Qi Decoction was used, and upon administration, the fever subsided. Additionally, this child has had jaundice since a young age, poor bowel movements, frequent Yang Ming dryness-heat, constant thirst, and often constipation, with slow cognitive responses. A single attack with Da Cheng Qi Decoction resolved these issues.\n\nXun Zhai stated: \"This pattern should be treated with appropriate medications. For 'jaundice disease,' use Yin Chen Hao Decoction; for abdominal fullness with shortness of breath, delirium, and constipation, use Cheng Qi Decoction. The unique symptom of restlessness and fidgeting is a manifestation of near-exhaustion of the spirit, which should not be treated.\" This phenomenon can be addressed with Da Cheng Qi Decoction. If the Bai Hu Decoction pattern causes severe heat, using Xi Jiao Di Huang Decoction may be beneficial, but if there is no passage of stool, it will not improve.",

In such cases, the prescription is \"Gui Zhi Decoction minus Shao Yao, plus Shu Qi, Long Gu, and Mu Li to Rescue Reversal Decoction.\"\n\nThe primary formula for internal treatment of burns in traditional Chinese medicine is \"Gui Zhi Decoction minus Shao Yao, plus Shu Qi, Long Gu, and Mu Li to Rescue Reversal Decoction.\" We can prepare this decoction at the scene of a fire to help people. When burns occur, the skin can be blistered and may even crack open, with large, painful blisters. Patients may become agitated and frantic due to the shock of the fire, as fluids rush to the surface of the skin, causing pain and preventing sleep, leading to restlessness and irritability. Zhang Zhongjing wrote about \"Rescue Reversal\" for emergency situations, as the pulse is floating, indicating that the illness is on the surface. When fire ignites, fluids rush to the surface of the skin without transforming into sweat, resulting in a significant amount of fluid accumulating on the skin's surface. When one takes a dose of \"Gui Zhi Decoction minus Shao Yao, plus Shu Qi, Long Gu, and Mu Li to Rescue Reversal Decoction,\" within about an hour, as the medicine disperses to the surface of the skin, the pain will significantly decrease. Since this is a rescue formula, it is crucial to quickly deliver the medicine to the skin's surface. Therefore, Shao Yao is removed from the Gui Zhi Decoction; Shao Yao has a sour and astringent nature, which is more constrictive. If Shao Yao were included, the medicinal properties would not be able to reach the skin's surface quickly. After the medicine reaches the skin's surface, Shu Qi is added. Shu Qi, also known as Changshan Miao, helps to eliminate phlegm. Normally, bodily fluids are contained within the gastrointestinal tract, but when exposed to intense heat, some of these fluids rush to the skin's surface, leading to the rapid formation of blisters due to the speed of this process.",

Once pathogenic factors enter the chest, the movement of water within the chest will not function normally, and a significant amount of energy will be expended to resist this. Consequently, it naturally leads to a blockage in this area, and the patient may experience nausea and vomiting. Therefore, whenever a patient exhibits vomiting, one should immediately consider the Shaoyang. Why is there vomiting? When the water pathways are not functioning properly, the stomach cannot absorb nutrients effectively, preventing them from entering the Sanjiao (Triple Burner) and the internal organs. As stated in the \"Neijing\" (Inner Canon): \"The Sanjiao is the pathway for water, the official for drainage.\" Thus, the Sanjiao serves as the transport system. In this situation, old food remains undigested because there is a pathogenic factor in the Sanjiao, preventing the production of new blood, and newly ingested food is not being processed, leading to stagnation in the gastrointestinal tract. This results in nausea, which are all primary symptoms of Shaoyang in the Sanjiao.\n\n#SECTION\n\n278. \"Shaoyang Wind,\" with both ears unable to hear, red eyes, fullness and agitation in the chest, should not be treated with vomiting or purging; if vomiting or purging occurs, it will lead to palpitations and agitation.\n\nIf it is Shaoyang, it also has symptoms of Taiyang (Greater Yang). Initially, when one contracts a wind pathogen, it presents as a Taiyang condition. At the same time, the Yang Qi in the gastrointestinal tract, which represents the immune system and the ability to consolidate the exterior, exerts part of its energy to resist the exterior pathogenic factors, leading to sweating. The fluids necessary to combat the exterior pathogens become insufficient. Under these conditions, the original illness has not resolved, and it progresses into Shaoyang, indicating that the fluids have already been damaged. When the fluids in the gastrointestinal tract are expelled to resist the exterior pathogens during the Taiyang condition, the illness transitions into Shaoyang because it could not withstand the attack. Therefore, the sweating method is employed to strengthen the immune system when fluids are deficient.",

Excessive vomiting can damage qi, which refers to harming the source of body fluids, as a significant amount of mucus and food is expelled. \n\nWhen purging, it can harm the blood, as blood is generated from the digestion of food in the small intestine. Ideally, food should be transformed into blood to nourish the body, but if it is eliminated before this transformation occurs, it can lead to blood deficiency.

Licorice and red dates can generate body fluids and replenish them. Other treatments should be determined based on clinical evidence. Hysteria currently has no effective treatment in Western medicine for this hidden dryness.\n\nFor women who vomit saliva, if the doctor purges them, it will lead to a feeling of fullness in the chest.

However, if a doctor mistakenly purges the patient, it can lead to a feeling of fullness in the chest, as the cold descends and sinks into the stomach.

          "english_text": "Why does menstruation stop and lead to this condition? Zhang Zhongjing stated that this illness is referred to as \"leucorrhea.\" For women's miscellaneous diseases, we have a unified term called \"leucorrhea.\" The reason for this is \"previous incomplete childbirth.\" Women may have experienced a miscarriage in their youth, resulting in \"stagnant blood remaining in the lower abdomen.\" Some individuals may have had retained blood in the uterus after childbirth, leading to the current symptoms of dryness in the lips and mouth. In such cases, \"Wen Jing Tang\" (Warm the Meridian Decoction) should be used for treatment. This is because when women experience amenorrhea, the uterus will atrophy, and using large doses of medicine to attack the condition is not appropriate. When the uterus is atrophied, we often use Wen Jing Tang, as there is stagnant blood in the lower abdomen. Wen Jing Tang is specifically used for conditions of cold deficiency in the uterus, so it can be applied not only during menopause but also for irregular menstruation or when there is stagnant blood in the uterus that cannot be expelled. It is also applicable for women experiencing infertility.\n\nWen Jing Tang has historically been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine as a prescription for seeking conception, so one can note \"long-term blood cold\" next to it, indicating that over the years, cold blood has accumulated at the entrance of the uterus and within the uterus itself. \"Cold\" refers to a lack of warmth, indicating a state of hypoxia, stagnation, and the presence of blood clots accumulating in the uterus. Therefore, Wen Jing Tang is also a prescription for seeking conception. \n\nAs for Wu Zhu Yu (Evodia rutaecarpa), Zhang Zhongjing selected it because it enters the liver meridian, which can invigorate liver blood and facilitate its flow to the uterus. Dang Gui (Angelica sinensis), Chuan Xiong (Ligusticum chuanxiong), and Shao Yao (Paeonia lactiflora) are all blood tonics that can increase blood volume.

When Yang Qi is abundant, blood will move accordingly; this is a combination of herbs that can both generate Yang and invigorate blood circulation. Ejiao (donkey-hide gelatin) is used for stopping bleeding and replenishing blood, as the patient has experienced blood loss. Danpi (Moutan root) is an herb that breaks up blood stasis, as women often have cold blood concentrated in the uterine orifice. If we forcefully attack it, the patient's body may become weak and depleted. Therefore, we must ensure that she has blood stasis or that the uterus is too cold to conceive before using it. Generally speaking, what Western medicine refers to as endometriosis corresponds to the syndrome of warming the meridians.\n\nThe \"twelve medicinal ingredients\" should be boiled in water, and after boiling, the residue should be removed, and the broth should be consumed. For \"women with cold in the lower abdomen,\" \"those who have not conceived for a long time, and those with excessive menstrual bleeding or delayed menstruation,\" as long as a woman's uterus is cold, she cannot conceive. Sometimes menstruation may be excessive, and sometimes it may be delayed; in both cases, Warming the Meridians Decoction can be used for treatment. For prolonged infertility, Warming the Meridians Decoction can also assist in conception, making it a very useful formula.\n\nFor leukorrhea, if menstruation is not smooth, with fullness and pain in the lower abdomen, and if menstruation is seen again after a month, the prescription is Tu Guo Gen San (Earth Gourd Root Powder).\n\nTu Guo Gen San formula:\nTu Guo Gen (Earth Gourd Root), Shao Yao (Peony), Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig), and Chan Chong (Silkworm) each three parts.\n\nThe four ingredients should be ground into a powder, and taken with a small spoonful of wine, three times a day. \n\nWhen discussing leukorrhea, it pertains to menstrual disorders. If a patient has \"menstruation not smooth, fullness and pain in the lower abdomen, and menstruation is seen again after a month,\" Tu Guo Gen San is indicated. If menstruation comes one month and then is absent the next month, returning again in the third month, with a month of amenorrhea in between, we should use Tu Guo Gen San for young women with cold accumulation in the uterus. The formula includes Tu Guo Gen, Shao Yao, Gui Zhi, and Chan Chong, among others.",

          "english_text": "During the middle of the menstrual cycle, if a young woman experiences amenorrhea due to cold accumulation in the uterus, we should use Tu Guo Gen San (Earth Gourd Root Powder). This formula contains ingredients such as Tu Guo Gen (Earth Gourd Root), Shao Yao (Peony), Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig), and Chan Chong (Silkworm). If Chan Chong is unavailable, it can be substituted with Tao Ren (Peach Kernel) or Hong Hua (Safflower). Additionally, we may include blood-activating and stasis-resolving herbs like San Leng (Sparganium) and E Zhu (Curcuma) that are used in certain prescriptions; these are all herbs that promote menstruation. Generally, if menstruation does not occur normally, we need to promote menstruation, and this is achieved with Tu Guo Gen San. If you wish to use Wen Jing Tang (Warm the Meridians Decoction), the primary symptom of the patient is dry lips and a dry mouth, indicating internal blood deficiency. If the patient does not have blood deficiency, there is no need to use Wen Jing Tang; simply using Tu Guo Gen San to promote menstruation will suffice. Both Wen Jing Tang and Tu Guo Gen San are used to treat blood stasis in the uterus, but the difference is that one is for blood deficiency and the other is for sufficient blood. Wen Jing Tang is used when there is insufficient blood, which leads to dry mouth and tongue.\n\nThe pulse at the cun (radial) position is wiry and large; a wiry pulse indicates deficiency, a large pulse indicates fullness, a deficient pulse indicates cold, and a hollow pulse indicates emptiness. Cold deficiency interacting with each other is termed \"ge\" (革). In women, this can lead to postpartum hemorrhage, while in men, it can result in loss of blood and sperm.\n\nThis has been introduced previously. \n\nFor women experiencing amenorrhea with continuous bleeding that is dark and unresolved, Jiao Jiang Tang (Ginger and Gelatin Decoction) is the main treatment.\n\nJiao Jiang Tang formula:\nJiao Ai Tang (Mugwort and Gelatin Decoction) plus dried ginger, as seen in \"Qian Jin Fang\" (Thousand Gold Prescriptions).\n\nWhat is meant by \"amenorrhea\"? It actually refers to blood collapse (excessive bleeding). Please note, \"amenorrhea is blood collapse.\" When a girl experiences blood collapse, it means there is a large amount of bleeding, or continuous dripping. Generally, menstruation lasts for five days, but if it continues for fifteen days without stopping, with continuous dripping, and \"dark and unresolved,\" it means the menstrual blood has turned black, indicating a lack of oxygen and insufficient yang. Jiao Jiang Tang is essentially a modification of Jiao Ai Tang.",

          "english_text": "The prescription specifically introduces how to treat this condition. \n\nThe pulse at the cun (寸) position is string-like and large; a string-like pulse indicates deficiency, while a large pulse indicates a hollow pulse. A deficient pulse suggests coldness, while a hollow pulse indicates emptiness. The interplay of cold and emptiness is termed \"ge\" (革). In women, this may lead to miscarriage, while in men, it can result in loss of blood and sperm.\n\nWhen palpating the pulse, if the fingertips press in the area between the cun and guan (關) positions, the pulse may jump from side to side. How can we, in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), determine that a woman is at risk of miscarriage? Because in a healthy individual, the blood from the heart flows down to the lower jiao (下焦) to nourish the fetus for its growth. The mother consumes food, which is digested by the spleen and stomach, and then passed to the lungs. The lungs, through the chong mai (衝脈), produce part of the breast milk and another part descends to the uterus, providing nourishment to the fetus. Additionally, blood from the liver enters the uterus, also aiding in the child's growth. Both of these pathways in TCM are sources of fetal blood.\n\nIf we palpate the pulse of a normal pregnant woman, it will flow continuously from the cun to the chi (尺) position. However, in the case of the patient, the pulse is jumping on both sides. The reason for the pulse jumping from side to side is due to internal deficiency and insufficient yin blood. When we have insufficient blood, there are two types of pulse symptoms that can be felt: the first is weak and almost imperceptible, indicating imminent death, as the blood flow is about to cease; at this point, the pulse is so small that it cannot even be felt. The second type indicates that there is still some blood present, but the patient's vitality is very strong; when palpating the pulse, it feels more urgent because the internal organs are competing for blood, causing the pulse to run on both sides.\n\nWhen a pregnant woman is weak, the blood within the uterus may be insufficient. This blood is originally meant to nourish the fetus for its growth, but if suddenly there is no blood, it can lead to miscarriage and continuous bleeding. A woman who is supposed to have her menstrual period once a month may instead experience it four times.",

A woman who is supposed to have her menstrual period once a month may experience it four or five times instead. Sometimes it lasts for three days and then stops, only to return shortly after, creating a continuous cycle.\n\nWhen a man encounters this type of pulse, it indicates \"loss of blood and essence,\" because a man's essence and blood share the same origin, just as a man's sweat and blood do. A man's essence is similar to a woman's breast milk, which is white. A woman's breast milk is transformed from nutrients by the heat of the heart before descending to the uterus to become blood. A man's essence is formed from the heat of the small intestine that vaporizes nutrients, and both are white in color. The treatment for postpartum bleeding and miscarriage will be introduced later. How should a man handle the loss of blood and essence? One might use Gui Zhi Long Gu Mu Li Tang (Cinnamon Twig, Dragon Bone, and Oyster Decoction), but this only prevents the loss of essence. If the goal is to enhance vitality, Gui Zhi Long Gu Mu Li Tang is not as effective; we need to rely on formulas like Tian Xiong San (Heavenly Hero Powder) and similar remedies.\n\nFor individuals who have lost blood, if they are induced to sweat, they may experience \"cold shivering and trembling.\" As I mentioned earlier, sweat and blood share the same origin in the human body. Therefore, individuals with conditions such as nosebleeds, blood loss, or sores should not be induced to sweat. Additionally, if a patient has numerous sores on their body, you should also refrain from inducing sweating.\n\nA patient presenting with fullness in the chest, dry lips, a bluish tongue, and a dry mouth may desire to rinse with water but not swallow, showing no signs of cold or heat. The pulse is weak, large, and slow, and the abdomen is not distended. The patient may express a feeling of fullness, indicating the presence of stagnant blood.\n\nThe phrase \"patient with fullness in the chest and dry lips\" marks the beginning of our discussion on the diagnostic principles of stagnant blood. How can we determine if there is stagnant blood in a patient's body? There are many causes of stagnant blood; some individuals may have retained remnants in the uterus after childbirth, while others may have internal injuries or trauma.",

Some individuals may have residual substances in the uterus after childbirth that have not been completely expelled, while others may experience internal injuries or trauma. Various accidents can also lead to blood stasis within the body. There are several symptoms that can help us in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnose whether a patient has blood stasis. \n\nThe first symptom is \"chest fullness,\" where the patient feels a sensation of fullness in the chest. The second symptom is \"dry and shriveled lips,\" where the lips appear dry and contracted. Why is this the case? I will explain shortly, but first, let’s note a few important symptoms. The second symptom is \"blue tongue and dry mouth,\" indicating dryness in the mouth and a bluish color of the tongue. In TCM, the concept is that \"the heart governs blood.\" Therefore, when there is blood stasis, the blood's return to the heart is insufficient, leading to the sensation of chest fullness. \n\nFor instance, when we use Gui Zhi Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction), if we encounter a patient with chest fullness, we need to remove Bai Shao (White Peony Root) because individuals with heart issues will experience chest fullness. Additionally, the spleen governs transportation and transformation; it is associated with the earth element and is yellow in color. The spleen plays a crucial role in the transportation of nutrients within the body. During the process of blood production, if there is blood stasis obstructing the body, this stasis may be located in the stomach or intestines, but regardless, the presence of blood stasis indicates a problem with blood circulation. Consequently, this will hinder the normal transportation of blood to the limbs. \n\nMoreover, the spleen opens to the lips, so at this time, we may observe that the patient's mouth appears drier and more withered, lacking moisture. The tongue may exhibit a bluish hue, which is not the entire tongue being blue, but rather the sides of the tongue body. This observation is derived from clinical experience, and I have seen many cases. Generally, when encountering individuals with internal injuries, extending the tongue reveals...",

Take one pill before meals each day, and if there is no effect, increase to three pills.\n\nLooking at this differentiation is not easy to understand, so I will explain it a bit for everyone to grasp. This differentiation actually discusses how we distinguish whether a patient is pregnant or if there is a tumor in the uterus. \"Zheng\" refers to blood clots or similar tumors, which may include stagnant blood clots or tumors that have not been expelled. During pregnancy, there should normally be no menstruation; this is the standard. For example, if menstruation is expected to occur on the 5th of this month but does not, how do we determine whether she is pregnant or has a pathological condition? We must first inquire about her menstrual history over the past three months. If her menstruation was very regular in the previous three months, it is possible that she is pregnant. If her menstruation was very irregular in the past three months, this does not necessarily indicate pregnancy. This is the first key point considered by Zhang Zhongjing.\n\nIf it is confirmed that she is pregnant, and by the third month, she experiences continuous bleeding, we must suspect the presence of a pathological condition. \"Women may have pathological conditions,\" meaning if the pregnant woman already has stagnant blood or a pathological condition in the uterus, most will experience continuous bleeding by the third month of pregnancy. \"Fetal movement at the navel\" actually does not refer to true fetal movement; rather, it indicates that due to the presence of stagnant blood, there may be palpitations that feel like movement at the navel. This is not true fetal movement but rather a sign that a mass is obstructing the growth of the fetus. In simple terms, if menstruation was very normal in the first three months of pregnancy, and by the third month there is continuous bleeding with bright red blood, it indicates a pathological condition.",

Simply put, if menstruation is normal during the first three months of pregnancy, but in the third month after conception there is continuous bleeding, and the blood is bright red, it indicates that pregnancy has occurred but there is a risk of miscarriage, which is not caused by any pathological condition. If menstruation was already abnormal during the first three months, and then there is a continuous absence of menstruation for three months, at this point it is unclear whether she has a pathological condition or is pregnant. If, after the third month, there is continuous dark bleeding, it indicates that there is a pathological condition in the uterus, not pregnancy. The practitioner wants to emphasize that it is crucial to confirm that the woman is not pregnant before prescribing medication; misdiagnosis could lead to a pregnant woman taking Gui Zhi Fu Ling Wan, which could result in miscarriage. \n\nAs for the continuous bleeding, why does her menstruation continue without stopping? It is because \"the pathology has not been resolved, hence the symptoms persist.\" Currently, in clinical practice, we find that Gui Zhi Fu Ling Wan is particularly effective for conditions such as uterine fibroids or ovarian tumors. I encountered a woman whose uterine fibroid was as large as a pomelo, and it felt very hard upon examination. Generally, women experience a depletion of their essence after the age of forty-nine, but this woman, at fifty-four, still had regular menstrual cycles. This lady is quite interesting; her perspective is unique. She had known about her uterine tumor for a long time, and despite the size, when Western doctors suggested surgery, she refused. She asked the doctor, \"Will this be fatal?\" The doctor replied, \"There is a slight chance, but it is not certain; perhaps one in a thousand.\" She said, \"I will take that one in a thousand chance; I do not want surgery.\" This woman is also very extraordinary.",

Previously, her menstrual cycle was very regular, but after she started taking Gui Zhi Fu Ling Wan, her menstruation continued without stopping. However, she felt great, did not become weak, and her abdomen began to shrink. She was only taking Gui Zhi Fu Ling Wan, without any additional special prescriptions. Therefore, for uterine fibroids, ovarian tumors, and other abdominal tumors in women, this formula can be used, and surgery should be avoided initially. Sometimes, after surgery, if bleeding does not stop, Western medicine may only resort to removing the entire uterus or the ovaries, which would prevent future pregnancies, leading to more complications, and sometimes even resulting in a loss of libido.\n\nSince the condition arises from blood stasis, Zhang Zhongjing employed both methods of breaking the mass and breaking the blood. The functions of Dan Pi (Moutan Cortex) and Tao Ren (Peach Kernel) are to invigorate blood circulation and dispel stasis. Traditional Chinese Medicine theory posits that a man's essence palace and a woman's uterus are merely gaps within the lower jiao's oil network, rather than being classified as an organ or a viscera. This is considered a problem within the oil network of the three jiao, which is why Fu Ling (Poria) is included. Fu Ling itself enters the three jiao and can facilitate the flow within the oil network. Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig) is used because it can promote the flow of the Chong Mai (Penetrating Vessel), allowing the blood from the upper jiao to descend. When the blood from the upper jiao descends, Fu Ling transports this new blood into the uterus, while Dan Pi and Tao Ren work to break up the old stagnant blood, effectively expelling the blood clots from within the uterine fibroids. During this process, there may be concerns about abdominal cramping; at this time...",

Therefore, it should be treated as an interior condition. When the illness is due to interior cold, we will use Fuzi Decoction. If we could ask the fetus at this moment, it would certainly say: \"Wow! My whole body hurts.\" The main symptom of Fuzi Decoction is generalized pain, with the skin feeling painful as if whipped.

It refers to menstrual bleeding that does not stop. Normally, menstruation lasts about five days; some may have it for four days, and others for three days. However, there are cases where menstruation continues for a month, which is incorrect. The complexion of the woman becomes dark, indicating severe abnormal discharge. The spleen is the organ that governs blood, while the liver is the organ that stores blood. If the spleen cannot transform and transport, and the liver does not store blood, then blood will leak out, indicating a deficiency of both the liver and spleen.

As a result, many young women may experience abnormal bleeding. Those who have studied the pulse of abnormal bleeding will recognize that the pulse is jumping on both sides in the area below the cun pulse and above the guan pulse, indicating that menstruation is flowing excessively.\n\nThe second condition is \"post-abortion bleeding that does not cease.\" Post-abortion refers to miscarriage.

At this time, adding a little Zhi Shi (Fructus Aurantii) is sufficient; do not add Da Huang (Rhubarb), as the mother is in a state of deficiency.\n\nFor postpartum diarrhea due to extreme deficiency, Bai Tou Weng (Pulsatilla) combined with Gan Cao (Licorice) and E Jiao (Donkey-hide Gelatin) decoction is indicated.\n\nBai Tou Weng, Gan Cao, and E Jiao Decoction formula:\n- Bai Tou Weng, Gan Cao, and E Jiao: each 2 liang (approximately 75 grams)\n- Qin Pi (Fraxini Cortex), Huang Lian (Coptis), and Bai Pi (Cortex Platycladi): each 3 liang (approximately 112.5 grams)\n\nTake these six ingredients, add 7 sheng (approximately 1.5 liters) of water, boil down to 2.5 sheng (approximately 0.5 liters), and ensure the E Jiao is completely dissolved. Divide into three warm doses.\n\nAs introduced in the \"Shang Han Lun\" (Treatise on Cold Damage), Bai Tou Weng Decoction is primarily used to treat heat-related issues. If a woman experiences both Qi and blood deficiency during her confinement period and also encounters heat-related diarrhea, in addition to using Bai Tou Weng Decoction, E Jiao and Gan Cao should be added. Gan Cao is used to tonify the middle, while E Jiao can nourish the blood. This is applicable when the body is in a deficient state and experiences heat-related issues. If such phenomena are absent, the heat-related diarrhea would simply correspond to the Bai Tou Weng Decoction syndrome. When Bai Tou Weng Decoction is used, the patient's stool will definitely have a foul odor. In summary, when encountering foul-smelling stools, persistent diarrhea, and a weak body, Bai Tou Weng combined with Gan Cao and E Jiao Decoction should be employed.\n\nIn the section on women's miscellaneous diseases and pulse diagnosis, it states: \"If a woman has a stroke for seven to eight days, followed by intermittent chills and fever, and her menstrual flow is suddenly interrupted, this indicates that heat has entered the blood chamber, causing blood stasis, which results in symptoms resembling malaria, with intermittent episodes. Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is indicated.\" \n\nThe phrase \"If a woman has a stroke for seven to eight days\" refers to a typical stroke that is unrelated to pregnancy.

Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is indicated for this condition. As I mentioned previously, when a woman experiences her menstrual cycle, it is due to the flow of milk descending along the Chong and Ren meridians into the uterus, where it transforms into menstrual blood. If a woman catches a cold at the same time as her menstrual cycle begins, the virus can enter the uterus along with the milk. Since the genital area is primarily governed by the liver meridian, the illness can then progress from the uterus to the liver, which is located above the diaphragm. Consequently, the patient may experience fullness in the chest and sides, and the condition can develop rapidly. At this point, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction may no longer be effective; instead, one should needle the Qimen point. Historically, many practitioners of classical formulas did not utilize acupuncture.\n\nThis section indicates that if the pathogenic factor has already entered the uterus, Zhang Zhongjing states that it is too late to use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. This is referred to as \"heat entering the blood chamber.\" If it is too late, we can perform acupuncture at the Qimen point. If there are still alternating symptoms of cold and heat, resembling malaria, we can continue using Xiao Chai Hu Decoction.

          "english_text": "Why does amenorrhea manifest in this way? Zhang Zhongjing stated that this condition is referred to as \"leucorrhea.\" For women's miscellaneous diseases, we have a unified term called \"leucorrhea.\" The reason for this is \"previous incomplete childbirth.\" Women may have experienced a miscarriage in their youth, leading to \"stagnation of blood in the lower abdomen.\" Some individuals may have retained blood in the uterus after childbirth, resulting in current symptoms such as dryness of the lips and mouth. In this case, \"Wen Jing Tang\" (Warm the Meridians Decoction) should be used for treatment. This is because when women experience amenorrhea, the uterus will atrophy, and using large doses of medication to attack the condition is incorrect. When the uterus is atrophied, we often use Wen Jing Tang, as there is stagnant blood in the lower abdomen. Wen Jing Tang is specifically used for cases of uterine deficiency and cold, so it can be applied not only during menopause but also for irregular menstruation or when there is stagnant blood in the uterus that cannot be expelled. It is also applicable for women experiencing infertility.\n\nWen Jing Tang has historically been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine as a prescription for seeking conception, so one can note \"long-term blood cold\" next to it, indicating that over the years, cold blood has accumulated at the entrance of the uterus and within the uterus itself. \"Cold\" refers to a lack of warmth, indicating a state of hypoxia, stagnation, and the presence of blood clots accumulating in the uterus. Therefore, Wen Jing Tang is also a prescription for fertility. \n\nAs for Wu Zhu Yu (Evodia rutaecarpa), Zhang Zhongjing selected it because it enters the liver meridian, which can invigorate liver blood and facilitate its flow to the uterus. Dang Gui (Angelica sinensis), Chuan Xiong (Ligusticum chuanxiong), and Shao Yao (Paeonia lactiflora) are all blood tonics that can increase blood volume. Ren Shen (Ginseng), Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig), along with the later additions of Sheng Jiang (Fresh Ginger) and Gan Cao (Licorice), are all yang-moving herbs that can invigorate yang energy. When yang energy is abundant, blood will also circulate, making these herbs effective for both generating yang and invigorating blood.",

          "english_text": "In cases of fluid deficiency, individuals often drink a lot of water but still cannot quench their thirst, continuously consuming more. This indicates that the stomach and intestines are originally deficient in fluids. As previously mentioned, this is due to a deficiency of stomach fluids. Therefore, if Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is prescribed to resolve the condition, administering a large dose of Xiao Chai Hu Decoction may cause the patient to sweat. In such situations, the first step is to needle the \"Dazhui\" point to release the excess heat from the Taiyang channel. Bloodletting at the \"Dazhui\" point is effective because the three Yang channels converge there, and once blood is released from \"Dazhui,\" the Taiyang heat will dissipate.\n\nWhy needle \"Fei Shu\" (Lung Back Shu)? This is because of the stiffness and pain in the head and neck, which occurs when Lung Qi is unable to disperse, preventing the exterior heat from dissipating. At this time, the heat from the chest Yang rises, causing headaches. Needling \"Fei Shu\" helps to release the exterior.\n\nWhy needle \"Gan Shu\" (Liver Back Shu)? This is due to liver swelling. It is essential to replenish the stomach's fluids when they are insufficient because if the fluids are lacking, the blood will become too hot, and there will not be enough water in the blood. At this point, the liver may swell because the liver is the final organ that stores blood; blood is stored in the liver, and while the heart generates blood, the liver stores it. In fact, the liver swelling is not a true Shaoyang syndrome; rather, the liver swelling presses against the stomach, causing hardness in the stomach area. Therefore, needling \"Gan Shu\" helps to release the heat from the blood, allowing the blood within the liver to flow out. Thus, this is not a genuine Shaoyang syndrome.\n\nWhen a patient suffers from fluid damage, it can be observed. Therefore, when administering a sweating remedy, one must first examine the patient's lips. If the lips are dry, sweating should not be induced, as it may lead to delirium. Why does sweating cause delirium? Generally, when a patient has a strong fever, the brain's nerves may not function normally, leading to incoherent speech. \"If the pulse is wiry and the patient experiences delirium for five to six days, one should needle 'Qimen',\" indicating that the liver is swollen.",

          "english_text": "At times, the brain nerves may not function normally, leading to incoherent speech. \"Pulse is string-like, with delirium lasting five to six days; one should needle 'Qimen',\" indicating that the liver has become swollen. For example, there was a patient whose entire mouth was cracked and dry, and who had acne on their face. The prescription included three qian of Fuzi (Aconite), one piece of raw Fuzi, and three qian of dried ginger, taken over three doses. This patient usually could not quench their thirst even when drinking water, due to a condition of vacuity heat. After taking such hot medicine, their thirst was alleviated. The patient's tongue coating was white and slippery, indicating a condition of internal stagnation. After administering the medicine, there would be a significant bowel movement, with dampness expelled through the stool.\n\n158. For women experiencing \"wind stroke,\" with fever and chills, if this condition persists for eight to nine days, and menstruation arrives appropriately, the heat will dissipate, and the pulse will become slow with the body feeling cool. There may be fullness in the chest and hypochondrium, resembling \"stagnant chest.\" If there is delirium, this indicates \"heat entering the blood chamber.\" One should needle \"Qimen\" and drain according to the condition.\n\nThe term \"women\" specifically refers to females. \"Wind stroke, fever, and chills\" indicates the presence of an exterior syndrome. \"If this persists for eight to nine days,\" it means that after seven to eight days of illness without improvement, menstruation arrives. \"Menstruation arrives appropriately, heat dissipates, and the pulse becomes slow with the body feeling cool.\" Why is this? Normally, the blood produced from the stomach's absorption of nutrients supports the body's resistance. Once the exterior pathogen invades, the resistance moves to the surface to combat it. At this time, menstruation occurs, causing the blood to descend, and the heat follows downwards as well. This pathogenic heat then enters the uterus and liver. The term \"blood chamber\" has been debated; some say it refers to the uterus, while others say it refers to the liver. In fact, both are considered blood chambers, and Zhang Zhongjing did not differentiate between them. \"Fullness in the chest and hypochondrium\" is due to the lymphatic system being associated with the Sanjiao (Triple Burner), where the uterus is considered the lower burner, and the chest and hypochondrium are considered the middle burner. \"Resembling stagnant chest\" indicates that it appears like stagnant chest. \"If there is delirium,\" it signifies that the patient's blood...",

          "english_text": "The \"Ba system\" refers to the Sanjiao (Triple Burner), with the uterus considered part of the lower jiao (lower burner) and the chest and hypochondrium considered part of the middle jiao (middle burner). \"As for the condition resembling chest obstruction,\" it appears as if there is a blockage in the chest. \"In cases of delirium,\" if the patient exhibits delirium, it indicates that the patient lacks sufficient blood. This is due to heat entering the blood chamber, which can occur from inflammation within the uterus or hepatitis. \"One should puncture the 'Qimen' point to drain the heat accordingly,\" as Qimen can dispel heat from the liver and gallbladder; Zhang Zhongjing was the only one who recognized this acupoint.\n\nThe term \"blood chamber\" refers to the liver, which is the site of the hepatic portal vein where the blood volume is the greatest and the heat is the highest, hence it is called the \"blood chamber.\" Wu's \"Treatise on Epidemics\" states: \"The 'blood chamber' is also known as the 'blood sea,' which corresponds to the Chong and Ren vessels. The classic texts refer to it as the 'uterus' because delirium often occurs during menstruation or when menstruation ceases, thus indicating that the 'uterus' is synonymous with the 'blood chamber.'\"\n\nCase 159: A woman experiencing \"wind stroke\" for seven to eight days, subsequently develops alternating chills and fever, with menstruation having just stopped, indicates \"heat entering the blood chamber.\" The blood must be congealed, leading to symptoms resembling \"malaria,\" with episodes occurring intermittently; \"Xiao Chai Hu Tang\" is the appropriate prescription.\n\nAfter needling \"Qimen,\" the subsequent condition aligns with the symptoms of Xiao Chai Hu Tang. The previous case involved a cold followed by menstruation, while this case involves a woman who had a cold and was initially recovering. However, just as her menstruation ceased, she caught another cold, which also indicates heat entering the blood chamber. The blood must be congealed because once heat enters the blood chamber, the circulation of blood is compromised, including the hepatic circulation. If filtering viruses enter, and if the blood is congealed there, it will certainly carry many viruses, leading to vascular blockage. The liver contains many blood vessels that need to expel blood; when circulation is smooth, the patient experiences fever, while when it is obstructed, the patient feels cold, thus exhibiting alternating symptoms of chills and fever. \"Hence, it resembles the symptoms of malaria, with episodes occurring intermittently.\"",

Therefore, when the patient has a good appetite and can eat normally, but the area around the eyes is dark, and upon palpating the pulse, it is rapid but without exterior heat, it indicates that pus has already formed. I use adzuki beans a lot; they not only clear heat but also detoxify. They can eliminate the toxins produced by peritonitis and are a well-known remedy for treating peritonitis. Whenever there is damp-heat toxicity, Zhang Zhongjing would use adzuki beans.\n\nFor yang toxicity, the symptoms include a face that is red and mottled like brocade, sore throat, and spitting pus and blood. It can be treated within five days, but not after seven days; the main formula is Shengma Bie Jia Decoction. For yin toxicity, the symptoms include a pale face, body aches as if beaten, sore throat, and it can also be treated within five days, but not after seven days; the main formula is Shengma Bie Jia Decoction minus realgar and Sichuan pepper.\n\nThe formula for Shengma Bie Jia Decoction is as follows:\nOne piece of turtle shell the size of a finger (roasted), half a tael of realgar (ground), two taels each of Shengma, Danggui, and licorice, and one tael of Sichuan pepper, stir-fried to remove moisture.\n\nTake these six ingredients, add four liters of water, boil down to one liter, and take it in one dose.

Western medicine currently only knows that this virus spreads very quickly, faster than the transmission rate of leprosy; once infected, it is often fatal. Western medicine still does not understand the true cause of this disease, but when they encounter it, their first action is to quickly isolate the patient. When rashes occur, they typically start from the abdominal area. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), if we see that the rash is red, the prognosis is grim, with a mortality rate of ten out of ten. If the rash is black, the prognosis is slightly better, with a survival rate of one out of ten, indicating that black rashes are the most dangerous. Western medicine recognizes the strong infectious nature of this disease and that there are no effective Western medications to treat it. Therefore, in such situations, all items that the patient has come into contact with are quickly gathered and burned.\n\nIf this infectious disease occurs during wartime, when soldiers have been infected after prolonged combat, the infection spreads rapidly. The onset begins from the abdominal area and quickly extends to the limbs, with the progression being swift; within one to two weeks, the individual may succumb to the illness, which is then referred to as \"war typhus.\" If it occurs in a prison, it is called \"prison typhus.\" On ships, it is termed \"ship typhus.\" Consider the commonalities among these locations. Firstly, the patients are all in a state of deficiency, as their diets are not normal. Secondly, they are confined within a limited space, lacking freedom of movement, which is why most of them contract this disease.\n\nIn TCM, there are two types of toxins: Yang toxin and Yin toxin.

Yang toxin primarily presents with symptoms such as \"facial redness with mottled patterns like brocade, and sore throat.\" Both Yang and Yin toxins can cause sore throat and expectoration of purulent blood. When the body is excessively hot, it is classified as Yang toxin, which corresponds to the syndrome of Shengma Bieja Decoction. If you observe \"a bluish complexion\" and \"body pain as if beaten with a stick,\" it resembles the sensation of being whipped. Why does this feeling occur? It is because the flow of blood has slowed down, to the point where it seems to be stopping. Due to the patient's poor blood circulation, the entire body feels as if it has been struck by a whip, resulting in pain. The symptoms of body pain can also be seen in Ma Huang Decoction, which occurs because the exterior is constrained by cold, preventing the Yang from circulating normally throughout the body, thus causing pain. However, the Yang syndrome is characterized by obstruction of the exterior water, while the Yin toxin is associated with obstruction of blood circulation; the two are entirely different. \n\nClinically, when using the prescriptions here, they include herpes, specifically what is known as shingles. The area affected by shingles feels as if it has been struck by a whip, causing significant pain, and at this time, we can utilize these formulas.

In addition to its role in promoting the flow of body fluids, Shengma also has detoxifying properties and can counteract various toxins. The choice of Bieja is because it is non-toxic in itself, but its nature is very strong and resilient. Furthermore, Bieja enters the liver meridian. When Bieja encounters Danggui (Angelica sinensis), since Bieja can penetrate deeply into the blood, when mixed with Danggui, it can reach the liver, and once it enters the liver, the liver will transform...",

          "english_text": "Due to excessive sweating all over the body, one jumps into the water to cool off. This does not mean that swimming in the Yellow River causes the body to turn yellow; in fact, jumping into the Yangtze River can also result in yellow sweat. The sweat produced from exercise originates from the Sanjiao (Triple Burner). When the body is sweating and one jumps into the water, the cold water from outside seals the skin's pores. Once the surface is sealed, the internal heat causes the moisture to try to escape but it cannot, resulting in the appearance of the skin not being yellow, yet the sweat that comes out is yellow. This is what is referred to as yellow sweat. If you see a patient with yellow skin, that indicates jaundice. Yellow sweat means that the patient's skin does not appear yellow, but the sweat that is secreted is yellow. Historically, the individuals most affected by yellow sweat were ferry boatmen, with the most distinctive symptom being the appearance of a yellowish color in the armpits of their clothing, which is the manifestation of yellow sweat.\n\nThe pulse is floating and surging; a floating pulse indicates wind, while a surging pulse indicates qi. When wind and qi clash, if the wind is strong, it leads to itching and the body feels itchy. Itching is a sign of wind being expelled, and if it persists, it can lead to scabs and leprosy. Strong qi leads to water retention, making it difficult to bend or stretch. When wind and qi are interconnected, the body becomes swollen, and sweating is a means of recovery. If one is averse to wind, this indicates a deficiency, which is classified as wind-water; if one is not averse to wind, it suggests smooth urination, with cold in the upper jiao (upper burner) and excessive salivation, which is indicative of yellow sweat.\n\nThe phrase \"the pulse is floating and surging; floating indicates wind, surging indicates qi\" refers to lightly palpating the pulse on the patient's wrist, where a floating and surging pulse indicates strong internal qi. The qi in our body emerges from within, while wind enters from the outside. When we feel the cold wind from outside, our internal yang naturally rises to counteract the external pathogenic factors. Therefore, the qi that emerges from the body is what we refer to in Traditional Chinese Medicine. The term \"wind and qi clashing\" describes the interaction between our internal yang qi and the external wind.",

          "english_text": "Evil forces resist each other, so what emerges from the body is Qi; in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the term \"Qi\" is often used. The phrase \"wind Qi contending\" refers to the conflict between the Yang Qi within our body and the external wind pathogens (filtered viruses). When the wind is stronger than the Yang Qi, it can lead to itching rashes, which are characterized by small, itchy red bumps on the skin. The saying \"the body is itchy, and itching leads to leakage\" indicates that when there is itching, one naturally tends to scratch. Scratching causes the Qi of the skin to leak out, which can alleviate the itching. \n\nIf the itching persists due to wind, a patient can be given Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang (Ephedra and Atractylodes Decoction). This formula is Ma Huang Tang (Ephedra Decoction) with the addition of Bai Zhu (Atractylodes), and its purpose is to induce a slight amount of surface sweating from the skin; it does not require excessive sweating to achieve a cure. The cause of the itching rash is that when the body is supposed to sweat normally, it is obstructed by the external wind, which constricts the sweat pores, preventing sweat from being expelled. At this point, the sweat has already left the sweat glands but has not exited the pores, so it remains trapped beneath the skin, leading to itching. This is not a true skin disease; therefore, by using Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang to expel the stagnant sweat, the itching rash can be resolved. \n\nMa Huang Jia Zhu Tang is well-designed for this purpose, as it can effectively release this layer of sweat without harming the normal body fluids. If the condition is due to liver disease causing ascites, one might say, \"Teacher, Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang can expel water.\" However, when this medicine is taken, the patient may not feel any effect, as it is a different type of fluid accumulation. It is essential to confirm that the fluid is trapped beneath the skin before using Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang. If you are unaware that Ma Huang Jia Zhu Tang specifically treats this type of itching rash and do not administer it to the patient, the wind rash, if left untreated for too long, will eventually develop into stubborn skin diseases such as scabs, leprosy, or scabies.",

If wind rash is left untreated on the body for too long, it will eventually develop into stubborn skin diseases such as scabs, leprosy, or scabies, which are essentially forms of psoriasis. The initial cause of these conditions arises in this manner. Otherwise, why would the rash appear on your body and not on someone else's? I once treated a patient with psoriasis who had a very large body frame; the skin, when pulled, revealed a large patch that was red and scaly, resembling fish scales, arranged in neat layers. When scraped, a lot of dry skin would come off, and soon after, it would grow back. I intentionally described it in a rather graphic way; as a doctor, one should not shy away from such details. After examining one side, the patient would then show me the other side, saying, \"Ah! I have it on my back too!\" When he pulled up his pants, his legs were covered, and there was a large patch on his thigh—his entire body was affected. Currently, Western medicine does not have effective treatments for this type of psoriasis. \n\nWhen encountering such skin diseases, it is important to understand that the root cause of these rashes is the presence of damp-heat within the body. If this damp-heat is not eliminated over a long period, and if sweat does not properly evaporate, it leads to the gradual accumulation of sweat beneath the skin. Meanwhile, the heat from the spleen and stomach cannot be expelled, resulting in it being trapped inside and transforming into damp-heat. At this point, if acupuncture is used for treatment, we can select anti-inflammatory points that are effective for skin diseases, such as Quchi, Hegu, Sanyinjiao, Xuehai, and Zhubin—these five acupoints are specifically for treating skin itching. Additionally, we can prick and bleed at the sites where the rash appears, and then apply a topical powder made from Sanhuang Xiexin Decoction mixed with a bit of Baizhu powder as an external remedy. Internally, the patient can take Wumei Wan. Wumei Wan is a bitter-warm medicine that can transform dampness; for dampness related to liver disease, Wumei Wan is essential.",

A woman who is supposed to have her menstrual period once a month may experience it four or five times instead. Sometimes it lasts for three days and then stops, only to return shortly after, creating a continuous cycle.\n\nWhen a man encounters this type of pulse, it indicates \"loss of blood and essence,\" because a man's essence and blood share the same origin, as do a man's sweat and blood. A man's essence is similar to a woman's breast milk in that it is white; a woman's breast milk is transformed from nutrients by the heat of the heart before descending to the uterus to become blood. A man's essence is formed from the heat of the small intestine that vaporizes nutrients, and both are white in color. The treatment for postpartum bleeding and miscarriage will be introduced later. How should a man handle the loss of blood and essence? One might use Gui Zhi Long Gu Mu Li Tang (Cinnamon Twig, Dragon Bone, and Oyster Decoction), but this only prevents the loss of essence. If one seeks to enhance vitality, Gui Zhi Long Gu Mu Li Tang is not as effective; we need to rely on formulas like Tian Xiong San (Heavenly Hero Powder) and similar remedies.\n\nFor individuals who have lost blood, if they are induced to sweat, they may experience \"cold shivering and trembling.\" As I mentioned earlier, sweat and blood share the same origin in the human body, so those with conditions such as epistaxis, blood loss, or sores should not be induced to sweat. Additionally, if a patient has numerous sores on their body, you should not induce sweating in that case either.\n\nA patient presenting with fullness in the chest, dry lips, a bluish tongue, and a dry mouth may desire to rinse with water but not swallow, showing no signs of cold or heat. The pulse is weak, large, and slow, and the abdomen is not distended. The patient may express a feeling of fullness, indicating the presence of stagnant blood.\n\nThe phrase \"patient with fullness in the chest and dry lips\" marks the beginning of our discussion on the diagnostic principles of stagnant blood. How can we determine if there is stagnant blood in a patient's body? There are many causes of stagnant blood; some individuals may have retained lochia after childbirth, while others may have internal injuries or trauma from falls.",

          "english_text": "Is there blood stasis in the body? There are many reasons for blood stasis. Some individuals may have residual lochia that has not been completely expelled after childbirth, while others may experience it due to internal injuries or trauma. Various accidents can also lead to blood stasis within the body. There are several symptoms that can assist us in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in diagnosing whether a patient has blood stasis. \n\nThe first symptom is \"chest fullness,\" where the patient feels a sensation of fullness in the chest. The second symptom is \"lip atrophy,\" characterized by dry and shriveled lips. Why is this the case? I will explain shortly, but first, let’s note a few important symptoms. The second symptom is \"blue tongue and dry mouth,\" indicating dryness in the mouth and a bluish color of the tongue. In TCM, the concept is that \"the heart governs blood,\" so when there is blood stasis, the blood's return to the heart is insufficient, leading to the sensation of chest fullness. \n\nFor instance, when we use Gui Zhi Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction), if we encounter a patient with chest fullness, we need to remove Bai Shao (White Peony Root) because individuals with heart issues will experience chest fullness. Additionally, the spleen governs transportation and transformation; it is associated with the earth element and is yellow in color. The spleen plays a crucial role in the transportation of nutrients within the body. During the process of blood production, if there is blood stasis obstructing the body, this stasis may be located in the stomach or intestines, regardless of its specific location. Blood stasis indicates a problem with blood circulation, which prevents normal blood from being transported to the limbs. \n\nMoreover, the spleen opens to the lips, so at this time, we can observe that the patient's mouth appears drier and more withered, lacking moisture. The tongue's bluish color is not uniform across the entire tongue but is observed on both sides of the tongue body. This is evident from clinical observations, and I have seen many cases. Generally, when encountering individuals with internal injuries, extending the tongue reveals...",

Generally, when encountering someone with internal injuries, if they stick out their tongue and the sides are bluish, it indicates internal injury. Additionally, patients may have a very dry mouth because blood has been obstructed by stasis, having already left the blood vessels and settled in the muscle tissue or between the organs, leading to such symptoms. Patients may express a desire to rinse their mouths but do not want to swallow; this reflects a psychological urge to drink water, yet when the water reaches their mouths, they do not want to ingest it. These symptoms are all indicative of external signs of blood stasis.\n\nIn our clinical practice, we have observed many women who, after undergoing surgery for breast cancer, experience a very dry mouth post-operation. They find it difficult to drink water, and even if they manage to drink, they end up vomiting it back. This is due to the presence of blood stasis within the body, which hinders proper blood circulation. At this time, they may feel very thirsty, yet drinking water leads to vomiting.\n\nThe term \"no cold or heat\" indicates that when you observe a patient with a dry tongue, it may suggest Yangming heat. When we take the pulse, it shows no signs of cold or heat, nor any exterior or interior symptoms; \"no cold or heat\" means there are not even exterior symptoms present. The pulse of blood stasis is slightly larger and arrives late; this requires clinical experience to feel and understand.\n\nWhen a patient says, \"My abdomen is not full, but I feel full,\" it means that although you observe the patient's abdomen is not distended, they continuously report a sensation of fullness and heaviness inside. However, upon external examination, there is no visible distension, which also indicates the presence of blood stasis within. All of the above are symptoms of internal blood stasis.\n\nYou mentioned: \"Teacher, today I encountered a mute person, and their hair was very long, covering their face.\" Or they may have sustained an injury, and their face is bruised, making it difficult for us to see.

          "english_text": "Then, his hair is very long, and his face is covered. Or he may have suffered an injury, and his face is bruised, making it difficult for us to see. How can you examine him? In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), there are very specific methods to check for blood stasis. When there is stasis in the body, there are several areas that can be examined, and this applies to both men and women. The left side of the human body is associated with blood, while the right side is associated with qi. In the lower left abdomen, above the Chongmen point, there is a tender point. Additionally, there is tenderness below the seventh vertebra in the back because blood can accumulate in the Ge Shu point. When pressure is applied to this area, even if the person is mute, there will be a strong reaction, such as the legs retracting or the brow furrowing.\n\nFurthermore, the Sanyinjiao point is where three yin meridians intersect. The term \"yin\" refers to the deepest areas, while \"yang\" refers to the surface; yin is comparatively deeper. When there is blood stasis within the organs, the blood does not remain stagnant; it gradually seeps into deeper tissues, at which point it enters the yin areas. The yin areas are not necessarily the genital region; for example, when there is blood stasis deep within the organs, such as beneath the liver or spleen, tenderness can also be found at the Sanyinjiao point, which can be observed clinically.\n\nThe most obvious and easily observable sign is the tongue. By extending the tongue, one can immediately discern the presence of blood stasis. For instance, if a woman's tongue has many tooth marks on the sides, it indicates gynecological issues. Additionally, if a person's tongue appears bluish with patchy distributions, this also signifies blood stasis. When blood stasis is present, we must first address the stasis; once the stasis is resolved, the illness will improve. Methods to address blood stasis include formulas such as Taohua Chengqi Decoction and Ditang Decoction, which are designed to invigorate blood circulation. When addressing blood stasis, it is crucial to be particularly careful with the prescription; we must assess the patient and determine the location of the stasis.",

Do not be nervous; the fetus in the abdomen will not be harmed.\n\nThe definition of the original formula by Dong Dongweng states: \"To treat those with blood stasis, there are two types of blood stasis. The first is when there is pain in the lower abdomen and frequent urination; the second is when the abdomen is not distended but the person feels fullness. For acute cases, use decoction; for milder cases, use pills.\" Difficulty in urination indicates blood stasis in the bladder, which corresponds to the Peach Kernel Chengqi Decoction. Frequent urination corresponds to the Didao Decoction. Additionally, if the abdomen feels soft to the touch and the patient feels discomfort in the abdomen, this is also a blood condition. For acute cases, use decoctions; for less urgent cases, use pills. Generally speaking, if the condition is superficial, the pain will be very acute; if the condition is deeper, the pain will be less urgent. Therefore, pills are used. Why use pills? Pills are characterized by their \"gentle and focused medicinal power.\" For \"acute conditions,\" it is necessary to expel quickly, hence the use of decoctions, as decoctions are for cleansing. For gastrointestinal issues, powdered medicines are preferable.\n\nThe \"Fang Yu Nao\" states: \"In cases of upper syndrome, those with body deficiency are often afflicted. A person with body deficiency, even if there is blood stasis in the lower abdomen, should not be attacked. However, if not attacked, the illness will not resolve. Well said! Chen Ziming modified this formula by removing 'rhubarb' and adding 'rehmannia,' naming it 'Tongjing Wan.' With just this one modification, it effectively addresses both the attacking and tonifying aspects. The military strategies of Sun Wu are not to be underestimated. I have used these four ingredients, decocted in water, to treat 'dry blood labor' with great efficacy.\" \"Dry blood labor\" refers to blood that has dried up in the abdominal cavity. The patient's external symptoms include \"skin peeling,\" which is often seen in girls, particularly on the legs and abdomen, and every winter, they experience skin shedding.",

This manifests as shedding skin on the legs and abdomen during winter, where the skin becomes dry and resembles snake skin, while in summer, it appears normal. This condition is essentially \"dry blood deficiency.\"\n\n139. \"Taiyang disease\" presents with jaundice, a deep and tight pulse, hardness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, indicating a lack of blood. If urination is smooth, the person may appear manic, which is a sign of blood stasis; \"Dingdang Decoction\" is indicated for this condition.\n\nThis can be further divided into two categories: one with smooth urination and one with difficulty in urination, to differentiate between blood presence and absence. If there is no blood, the symptoms include jaundice, a deep and tight pulse, hardness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, indicating a lack of blood. In such cases, \"Yinchenhao Decoction\" will be used. Yinchenhao Decoction specifically targets heat in the bladder. When there is heat burning below, after the bladder has been vaporized, some unhealthy urine is expelled while some good fluid enters the gallbladder, secreting bile to aid digestion. Bile is yellow; if there is excessive heat in the bladder, the secretion of bile becomes too heated, leading to jaundice in the patient. One should not underestimate blood stasis; it may not be visible on X-rays, yet it can lead to manic behavior. This stasis can sometimes affect the brain. Depending on the situation, either \"Dachengqi Decoction\" or \"Dingdang Decoction\" may be used, so it is essential to observe the urination patterns. If urination is smooth, \"Dingdang Decoction\" is appropriate; if the urine is very yellow, it indicates excessive heat in the lower jiao, and if there is no bowel movement, \"Dachengqi Decoction\" should be used to purge.\n\n140. \"Shanghan\" (cold damage) presents with heat, fullness in the lower abdomen, and should have difficulty in urination. If there is currently smooth urination, it indicates the presence of blood, and one should purge immediately without leaving any medication behind, preferably using \"Dingdang Pill.\"\n\nHeat accumulation in the bladder should typically result in difficulty urinating; however, if urination is normal, the patient reports pain in the lower abdomen around the \"Zhongji\" and \"Guanyuan\" areas. If there is no passage, there will be pain, but if urination is good, it indicates that blood is obstructed.",

          "english_text": "The patient initially experienced difficulty urinating, but now their urination is normal. The patient reports significant pain in the lower abdomen, particularly around the \"Zhongji\" and \"Guanyuan\" points. The pain is associated with obstruction; however, urination is good, indicating that blood is blocked. The difficulty in urination may be due to kidney stones, and the use of Wuling San (Five-Ingredient Powder) could help resolve this issue. Currently, the patient is experiencing considerable pain, but upon palpation, the abdomen feels soft, suggesting that there is stagnant blood inside. To differentiate whether there is blood stagnation, we assess the urination; if it is not smooth, we note that \"no excess medicine should be used, and it is advisable to use Diding Wan (Resisting the Pathogen Pill).\" Other medications are ineffective, and it is essential to use Diding Wan. The symptoms appear milder compared to those treated with Diding Decoction, but the underlying condition is more severe.\n\n**Diding Wan Formula:**\n- 20 pieces of leech (boiled)\n- 25 pieces of fly larvae (boiled, wings removed)\n- 20 pieces of peach kernels (peeled and pointed ends removed)\n- 3 taels of rhubarb (soaked in wine)\n\nCombine these four ingredients, grind them into a powder, and form into four pills. Use one pill with one liter of water, boil it down to seven portions, and take it. If blood is expelled, it is effective; if not, take another dose. \n\nPeach kernels are very sticky, and crushed leeches are also sticky, so divide the mixture into four pills. Generally, 20 leeches weigh about 2 qian, 25 fly larvae weigh approximately 2.5 qian, 20 peach kernels weigh 2 qian, and 3 qian of rhubarb. The term \"晬時\" refers to taking the medicine today, and it should be at least 24 hours before observing any blood. If blood is expelled, there is no need to continue taking it; one pill at a time is sufficient. The amount of stagnant blood varies among individuals, so while the prescription remains the same, the dosage may differ. Stop taking the medicine once the desired effect is achieved.\n\nAccording to the \"Liu Ju Fang Guang Yi,\" this formula states: \"In my family, we use this formula, taking the four ingredients to make a powder and refining it with honey into pills.\" Using raw honey will enhance the effect. It also states: \"If it forms into lumps, it is suitable for chronic patients. Although they may have taken medicine regularly, it is still difficult to achieve results.\"",

          "english_text": "In comparison to heat, when the internal deficiency heat interacts with the external yang heat, the patient feels very uncomfortable. In winter, this condition tends to improve because the cold outside can restrain the heat. Additionally, individuals with severe labor syndrome may experience the phenomenon of \"yin cold essence emerging.\"\n\nZhang Zhongjing simply explained that most people suffering from labor syndrome have heat above and cold below; that is, the area above the navel is hot, while the area below is cold. The navel serves as the boundary between yin and yang. The lower part is characterized by yin cold, which signifies a lack of dynamic energy and a cessation of peristalsis, leading to poor metabolism. Conversely, the upper part is excessively hot and overactive. In a healthy individual, yin is above and yang is below, which prevents yang from floating upwards, allowing our dynamic energy to remain hidden, referred to as \"latent yang.\" In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), it is understood that yang should not be excessive, but it must be able to remain latent.\n\nTherefore, if a patient has yang heat above that cannot descend, this heat will rise to the limbs. At this time, the lower jiao becomes a gathering place for yin cold, leading to the phenomenon of \"essence emerging.\" The patient may experience several symptoms; for men, this manifests as nocturnal emissions or dreams of sexual intercourse. Older individuals often experience this phenomenon of essence emerging due to yang deficiency, which leads to a lack of control, causing essence to leak out involuntarily. This symptom is very distressing, but can be quickly treated with herbal medicine.\n\nFurthermore, the symptom of \"soreness and weakness preventing movement\" occurs because the lower jiao is deficient and cold, causing essence to leak out. Women do not have essence, but when this condition occurs in women, there will be an excessive discharge of leukorrhea, which continuously drips out, leading to a depletion of vital energy. When this phenomenon occurs, it can affect sleep at night. This is because the kidneys govern the bones.",

          "english_text": "Excessive vaginal discharge can occur, continuously dripping out, which can lead to a deficiency in the body. When this phenomenon happens, it can affect sleep at night. Since the kidneys govern the bones, if the patient's kidney essence is excessively depleted, they will experience soreness in the bones. The term \"soreness that prevents movement\" refers to the patient feeling soreness in the bones rather than in the muscles. Therefore, some individuals who have suffered from labor-related conditions for many years without treatment may eventually develop nocturnal emissions. When this essence continuously leaks out, the patient cannot endure it and naturally feels very distressed, experiencing daily fatigue. We have Chinese herbal medicine that can help stabilize their Yang deficiency, as well as herbs that can replenish their Yin deficiency, among other treatments.\n\nIn men, a weak and floating pulse indicates infertility, with clear and cold essence. Here, it is stated that if the pulse is \"floating and weak,\" the floating pulse represents the Qi pulse. When the pulse rises, it indicates that the Qi is ascending, meaning the patient's exterior is deficient. A weak pulse indicates insufficient blood, which also signifies that the patient's essence and blood are inadequate, indicating an internal deficiency. Patients exhibiting this phenomenon will certainly struggle with infertility because of the \"clear and cold essence.\" Such men find it difficult to conceive children, meaning that those with labor-related conditions are less likely to become pregnant. However, we have prescriptions in Chinese medicine that can treat this condition. You can refer to the formula below; after trying one or two doses, you will know whether it is effective.\n\nThus, if a 17 or 18-year-old child has a pale complexion, this indicates that they are in the early stages of development, and this physiological response may cause nocturnal emissions during sleep. If it only happens occasionally, one or two times, it is quite normal and not a significant concern, as fullness leads to overflow. However, if it becomes severe, the person will become deficient, and at this point, their complexion will appear pale, and they will exhibit a lack of energy.

This occurs because water cannot nourish wood; the liver governs the tendons, and without water to moisten the liver wood, the tendons become tight, as the liver's tendons are directly connected to the lower abdomen. Typically, if there is pain in the lower abdomen, it is often due to excessive cold in the spleen, and at that time, classical herbalists would frequently use Bai Shao (White Peony) to alleviate abdominal pain. However, in this situation, using Bai Shao is ineffective because the patient is experiencing \"tight tendons,\" which is due to liver deficiency.\n\nThe term \"coldness in the genital area\" indicates that even the front of the genital region feels cold. At this time, there is often accompanying dizziness. \"Hair loss\" refers to the loss of hair as well. The pulse being \"extremely weak, thin, and slow\" indicates that the internal essence is severely depleted. The symptom of \"diarrhea with clear grains\" means that food ingested is not properly absorbed due to excessive cold in the stomach and intestines, leading to undigested food being expelled.

There are three types of diabetes symptoms: the first type is upper burner diabetes, characterized by severe thirst where no amount of water can quench it. After taking Ren Shen Bai Hu Tang for a few doses, blood sugar levels will return to normal. The second type is lower burner diabetes, primarily manifested as impotence. Shen Qi Wan may need to be taken for a longer duration, approximately six months continuously. The third type is middle burner diabetes, where one feels extremely hungry and cannot be satisfied, caused by excessive heat in the spleen. This is what I am going to introduce now.\n\nWhen treating middle burner thirst, the prescription must pay attention to two main points: first, it is essential to slow down the stomach's peristalsis, which means reducing stomach fire. Second, it is necessary to clear out the waste in the large intestine simultaneously, as the large intestine is inherently hot. If a lot of waste accumulates inside, the heat cannot dissipate and becomes trapped, leading to increased heat. Therefore, it must be cleared out at the same time.\n\nThese pathogenic causes are closely related to the busy social behaviors of our current industrial and commercial society, as well as our lifestyle habits. Sitting at work every day means our blood sugar needs more movement to be consumed. However, due to excessive time spent sitting in the office and lack of exercise, combined with sometimes being too busy to eat properly during the day, we end up having a late-night snack when we return home before sleeping. Consequently, food remains in the stomach for too long. \n\nIdeally, it is healthier for our stomach to be empty while we sleep, as the stomach's peristalsis gradually slows down during sleep. If we eat a lot of food before sleeping, the stomach will be occupied with food, and the stomach...",

          "english_text": "During sleep, the stomach's peristalsis gradually slows down. If a person eats a lot of food before going to bed, the stomach, which contains food, cannot remain inactive and thus experiences pressure and congestion. Normally, at night, the stomach fire decreases and peristalsis slows down. However, if food is ingested, it stimulates the stomach to continue moving, leading to a situation where the stomach is active while the person is asleep. Over time, this can result in elevated blood sugar levels. \n\nWestern medicine states that diabetes can be hereditary, but this is a partial truth; it should be prefaced with the phrase \"lifestyle habits.\" It is not a matter of hereditary constitution. Today, if the pancreas becomes fatty, it does not mean that a son will inherit a fatty pancreas—such a thing does not happen. In reality, it is due to shared lifestyle habits. For instance, a father who is busy working in a factory or company may not see his wife and children all day. When he returns home late, he calls out, \"Everyone get up and eat with Dad; I want to chat with you.\" Thus, the family ends up having late-night snacks together, discussing school matters, and then going to bed, day after day. \n\nIf the father's lifestyle habits are unhealthy, he may develop diabetes, and consequently, the son may adopt the same late-night snacking habits, leading to the son also developing diabetes. This is what is meant by the inheritance of lifestyle habits. Men between the ages of thirty-five and forty-five are particularly prone to this issue, as many are striving to reach the peak of their careers during this time. As a result, children also develop the habit of late-night snacking. Therefore, many people in their fifties find that while they have earned money, they discover they have diabetes when they want to enjoy their lives. In Chinese culture, the belief is that...",

Many people develop habits of eating late-night snacks, and by the time they reach their fifties, they may have earned a good income, but when they want to enjoy life, they find out they have diabetes. In Chinese culture, there is a saying, \"Food is the heaven for the people,\" indicating that diet is a form of enjoyment in life. As a result, those with diabetes cannot eat freely. Children who grow up eating late-night snacks with their fathers also develop this habit; they feel shaky if they don’t eat, and they must eat at night to be able to sleep. This is the reason behind it.\n\nThere are also external symptoms; in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), it is believed that if the exterior symptoms are not treated, the disease can progress to the Yangming stage, leading to persistent thirst and dryness, which is also a pathogenic cause. Zhang Zhongjing did not prescribe for diabetes, but I actually use Ze Lan Wan (a traditional herbal formula). People with diabetes tend to gain weight due to insulin injections and blood sugar-lowering medications, not because they are diabetic. If there were a medicine that not only prevents weight gain but also helps them lose weight, the mere fact that patients lose weight would indicate a decrease in blood sugar levels. \n\nFor the condition of thirst and hunger in the middle jiao (the digestive system), a prescription must be designed to reduce stomach fire while also promoting bowel movement. Originally, patients would eat a hundred bowls of food and still feel hungry, but after taking Chinese medicine, they would feel full after eating just a little, indicating that their stomach has shrunk. At this point, the temperature of the spleen and stomach would immediately drop, and the heat in the large intestine would be expelled along with the stool.\n\nIn ancient times, there were no airplanes or cars; visiting neighbors required walking several kilometers, so most people had a lot of physical activity. Therefore, this condition was more common among wealthy families. Nowadays, with many cars and a lifestyle of comfort, people sit without moving, leading to an increase in diabetes cases. If diabetes is not treated, it will eventually progress to complications.",

Do not be anxious; the fetus in the abdomen will not be harmed.\n\nThe definition of the original formula by Dong Dongweng states: \"For the treatment of blood stasis, there are two types of conditions. One is when there is pain in the lower abdomen and frequent urination; the other is when the abdomen is not distended, but the person feels fullness. For urgent cases, use decoction; for less urgent cases, use pills.\" Difficulty in urination indicates blood stasis in the bladder, which corresponds to the Peach Kernel Chengqi Decoction. Frequent urination corresponds to the Didao Decoction. Additionally, if the abdomen feels soft to the touch and the patient feels discomfort in the abdomen, this is also a blood condition. For urgent cases, use decoctions; for less urgent cases, use pills. Generally speaking, if the condition is superficial, the pain will be very acute; if the condition is deeper, the pain will be less urgent. Therefore, pills are used. Why use pills? Pills are characterized by their \"gentle and focused medicinal power.\" For \"acute conditions,\" it is necessary to expel quickly, hence the use of decoctions, as decoctions are for cleansing. For gastrointestinal issues, powdered medicines are preferable.\n\nThe \"Fang Yu Nao\" states: \"In cases of upper syndrome, those with body deficiency are often afflicted. A person with body deficiency may have blood stasis in the lower abdomen, but it should not be attacked. However, if not attacked, the illness will not resolve. Well said! Chen Ziming modified this formula by removing 'rhubarb' and adding 'rehmannia,' naming it 'Tongjing Pills.' This slight modification effectively addresses both the attacking and tonifying aspects. The military strategies of Sun Wu are not to be underestimated. I have used these four ingredients, decocted in water, to treat 'dry blood labor' with great efficacy.\" \"Dry blood labor\" refers to blood that has dried up in the abdominal cavity.

If there is no blood, the patient will exhibit jaundice, a deep and tight pulse, hardness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, indicating a lack of blood. In such cases, \"Yinchenhao Decoction\" will be used. Yinchenhao Decoction specifically targets heat in the bladder. When there is heat burning below, after the bladder has been vaporized, some unhealthy urine is expelled while some good fluids enter the gallbladder, secreting bile to aid digestion. Bile is yellow; if there is excessive heat in the bladder, the secretion of bile becomes too heated, leading to jaundice in the patient. One should not underestimate blood conditions; X-rays cannot detect blood, and as a result, the patient may become manic. This stagnant qi can sometimes travel to the brain. At times, \"Dachengqi Decoction\" is used, and at other times, \"Dingdang Decoction\" is appropriate. Therefore, it is essential to observe whether urination is smooth or obstructed.

The difficulty in urination may be due to kidney stones, and the use of Wuling San (Five-Ingredient Powder) could help resolve this. Currently, the patient is experiencing considerable pain, but upon palpation, the abdomen feels soft, suggesting that there is stagnant blood inside.

If blood is expelled, it should occur within a day; if not, take another dose. The peach kernels are very sticky, and the crushed leeches are also sticky, so they are divided into four pills. Generally, 20 leeches weigh about 2 qian, 25 fly larvae are approximately 2.5 qian, 20 peach kernels weigh 2 qian, and rhubarb is 3 qian. \"Within a day\" means that after taking the medicine today, it should take at least 24 hours to see blood. If blood is expelled, there is no need to continue; if not, take another pill. The amount of stagnant blood varies among individuals, but the prescription remains the same, though the dosage may differ. Stop taking the medicine once the desired effect is achieved.\n\nAccording to the \"Liuju Fang Guangyi,\" this formula states: \"In my family, we use this formula, taking the four left ingredients and grinding them into a powder, then refining with honey into pills.\" Using raw honey will enhance the effect.

However, he experiences multiple daily bowel movements with loose, unformed stools, without blood or mucus. These symptoms suggest a condition of spleen deficiency with dampness accumulation. According to TCM theory, the spleen governs transformation and transportation; if it is deficient, its function is weakened, leading to internal dampness and resulting in loose stools. The patient's inability to control bowel movements and frequent trips to the restroom may be related to spleen deficiency and intestinal dysfunction. It is recommended to use a formula to strengthen the spleen and resolve dampness to improve the condition.\n\nPrescription: Spleen-strengthening and damp-resolving formula:\n1.

However, he experiences multiple daily bowel movements with loose, unformed stools, without blood or mucus. These symptoms suggest a condition of spleen deficiency with dampness accumulation. According to TCM theory, the spleen governs transformation and transportation; if it is deficient, its function is weakened, leading to internal dampness and resulting in loose stools. The patient's inability to control bowel movements and frequent trips to the restroom may be related to spleen deficiency and intestinal dysfunction. It is recommended to use a formula to strengthen the spleen and resolve dampness to improve the condition.\n\nPrescription: Spleen-strengthening and damp-resolving formula:\n1. Bai Zhu (Atractylodes) 15g\n2. Fu Ling (Poria) 15g\n3. Yi Yi Ren (Job's Tears) 30g\n4. Gan Jiang (Dried Ginger) 10g\n5. Gan Cao (Licorice) 6g\n6.

          "english_text": "In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), one must wait until the internal deficiency has been resolved before administering exterior-releasing herbs. Therefore, when encountering a patient with internal deficiency, it is essential to first treat the internal deficiency before addressing the exterior symptoms.\n\n116. For \"Taiyang disease,\" if it has persisted for more than ten days and has recurred two or three times, and after another four or five days the \"Chaihu syndrome\" is still present, one should first administer \"Xiao Chai Hu Tang.\" If the patient experiences persistent vomiting, a sense of urgency in the chest, and mild irritability, this indicates that the condition has not been resolved; in this case, administering \"Da Chai Hu Tang\" will lead to recovery.\n\nThe phrase \"persisted for more than ten days\" indicates that the illness has been prolonged for over ten days, and logically, it should have progressed to another stage. However, if the exterior symptoms remain and the physician does not prescribe exterior-releasing herbs but instead resorts to purging, the original Taiyang syndrome, which should have resolved the exterior symptoms and allowed the illness to manifest outwardly, instead moves inward. If after another four or five days the Chaihu syndrome is still present, one should first give Xiao Chai Hu Tang. If the patient continues to experience \"persistent vomiting, a sense of urgency in the chest, and mild irritability,\" this indicates that the stomach is still distended and uncomfortable due to unresolved food stagnation; thus, administering Da Chai Hu Tang will lead to recovery.\n\nDa Chai Hu Tang itself is situated between the Shaoyang and Yangming stages, and it is used when both Shaoyang and Yangming symptoms are present. The symptoms of \"persistent vomiting, a sense of urgency in the chest, and mild irritability\" suggest that the intestines and stomach are obstructed by fecal matter, with retained food causing blockage. Therefore, the primary symptoms of Da Chai Hu Tang include abdominal fullness, distension, and vomiting; vomiting is associated with Shaoyang, while abdominal fullness is linked to Yangming. Abdominal fullness and nausea are the main symptoms of Da Chai Hu Tang. In modern contexts, the symptom of fullness due to qi stagnation corresponds to the formula of Hou Po, Sheng Jiang, Ban Xia, and Gan Cao; fullness due to excess corresponds to Cheng Qi Tang; and abdominal fullness with nausea corresponds to Da Chai Hu Tang. If there is only vomiting without abdominal fullness, it indicates Xiao Chai Hu Tang syndrome. Why is this the case? Because the purging herbs were too aggressive, leading to excessive loss of fluids from the patient, resulting in watery stools.",

          "english_text": "The presence of abdominal fullness and light vomiting indicates a Xiao Chai Hu Tang syndrome. Why is that? Because the condition has been purged too quickly with a laxative, causing the patient to lose too much fluid; the stools that are expelled are mostly watery, resulting in feces being retained inside. Clinically, we observe that patients with colon cancer initially present with either Cheng Qi Tang syndrome or Da Chai Hu Tang syndrome. They are not in the Yangming stage, but rather in a state between Shaoyang and Yangming. In Yangming, there are no signs of death, and this situation is not dangerous. However, patients treated by Western medicine who undergo surgery may develop liver cancer or lung cancer afterward, presenting symptoms that align with either Shaoyin syndrome or Jueyin syndrome. Therefore, we naturally oppose surgical interventions by Western medicine.\n\nFor patients with colon cancer who have not yet undergone surgery, if the blockage is near the end of the colon, specifically around the rectum, we need to add Mangxiao to break the blockage. When we encounter constipation with excess syndrome, where the patient resists abdominal palpation and cannot pass gas, we consider using Mangxiao.\n\nThe formula for Da Chai Hu Tang is as follows:\n- Chai Hu: 250 grams\n- Huang Qin: 150 grams\n- Shao Yao: 150 grams\n- Ban Xia: 75 grams (washed)\n- Sheng Jiang: 250 grams (sliced)\n- Zhi Shi: 4 pieces (roasted)\n- Da Zao: 12 pieces (split)\n- Da Huang: 100 grams (approximately 75 grams of Ban Xia)\n\nCombine these eight ingredients with 12 liters of water, boil down to 6 liters, strain, then re-boil to obtain 3 liters. Administer 1 liter warm, three times a day.\n\nFor Da Huang, heavier individuals can use 6 grams, while lighter individuals can use 3 grams. The combination of Chai Hu, Huang Qin, Ban Xia, Sheng Jiang, and Da Zao constitutes Xiao Chai Hu Tang. By omitting Ren Shen and Gan Cao, and adding Shao Yao, Zhi Shi, and Da Huang, we create Da Chai Hu Tang. Zhi Shi is also a herb that can help relieve constipation, similar to Hou Po; however, Zhi Shi is more effective for the large intestine, while Hou Po is more effective for moistening the small intestine. The large intestine and lungs are interrelated, so when there is a blockage in the large intestine, Zhi Shi is used.",

          "english_text": "In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Zhi Shi (Fructus Aurantii) is similar to Hou Po (Magnolia Officinalis) in that it is more effective for the large intestine, while Hou Po is more effective for moistening the small intestine. The large intestine and lungs are interconnected, so when there is blockage in the large intestine, Zhi Shi is used. It is also used when there is congestion in the chest cavity or fluid accumulation in the heart. Zhi Shi is specifically capable of eliminating toxic masses and hard lumps, facilitating their expulsion. \n\nIn practice, it has been observed that when the intestinal wall of the large intestine adheres to the stool, Zhi Shi can help separate them. However, it can only create separation; if Zhi Shi were to clear it out completely, there would be no need to add Da Huang (Rhubarb) or Mang Xiao (Glauber's Salt). Therefore, Zhi Shi itself does not have a purgative function; it merely separates the blockage, and other herbs are required to facilitate the passage.\n\nWhen there is blockage in the arterial blood vessels of the heart, Zhi Shi is used, but it only separates the obstructive material from the vessel walls. Zhang Zhongjing also added Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig) to enhance the outward force of the heart's arterial blood vessels, increasing the ejection force. To prevent the stomach from being overwhelmed, Sheng Jiang (Fresh Ginger) is added to disperse some of the heat, preventing it from concentrating too much on the heart, which could lead to rupture of the blood vessels.\n\nDue to abdominal fullness and distension, with pain in the lower abdomen, Shao Yao (Peony) is added. If Da Huang is not included in Da Chai Hu Tang (Major Bupleurum Decoction), it cannot be called Da Chai Hu Tang, as the condition has already entered the Shao Yang and Yang Ming stages, and it is not a pure Yang Ming syndrome. Therefore, there is no need for a strong herb like Mang Xiao; using Da Huang to clear the Yang Ming heat is sufficient. \n\nDa Chai Hu Tang is essentially Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Minor Bupleurum Decoction) with Ren Shen (Ginseng) and Gan Cao (Licorice) removed, and Zhi Shi, Da Huang, and Shao Yao added. In cases of Yang Ming excess heat, it is inappropriate to use Ren Shen and Gan Cao, which are tonifying herbs, because the Yang Ming syndrome has already affected the intestines. One should not use Gan Cao to keep the herbs stagnant in the stomach, as Yang Ming excess heat is present.",

          "english_text": "Herbs can quickly restore gastrointestinal function; however, after taking the Li Zhong Tang, the diarrhea may worsen. Li Zhong Tang addresses the deficiency of the \"middle jiao\" (the central digestive region), and when it is attacked, it leads to a deficiency in the \"lower jiao\" (the lower digestive region). Therefore, strengthening the middle jiao is ineffective at this point, and the prescription of Chi Shi Zhi and Yu Yu Liang Tang should be used instead. \n\nThe principle stated in the \"Shang Han Lun\" and \"Jin Kui\" is that when treating diarrhea, if the prescription does not stop the diarrhea, one should promote urination. The goal is to direct the water from the large and small intestines to the bladder to be expelled as urine, thereby stopping the diarrhea. In clinical practice, this approach can be applied to conditions such as cholera and dysentery, where there is vomiting and diarrhea. Promoting urination can help stop the diarrhea, and the best herbs for this purpose are Zhu Ling and Ze Xie. Therefore, these herbs should be added to the formulas aimed at stopping diarrhea.\n\nGenerally speaking, when diarrhea is severe, one should first use Chi Shi Zhi and Yu Yu Liang, as these two herbs are astringents and belong to the category of stone herbs. Currently, Yu Yu Liang is rare, and most of what is available on the market is Chi Shi Zhi. In clinical cases of persistent diarrhea, it is not necessary to use Chi Shi Zhi and Yu Yu Liang Tang, as Yu Yu Liang is not easily obtainable. Instead, one can use Bai Zhu and Chi Shi Zhi. Bai Zhu is typically processed in the pharmacy by frying it with yellow earth, and there is also a method where Bai Zhu is fried together with Chi Shi Zhi. When Bai Zhu is used to strengthen the stomach and spleen, it is usually prepared with \"fried yellow earth,\" while for stopping diarrhea, it is prepared with \"fried Chi Shi Zhi.\" Adding this to Xiao Jian Zhong Tang or Ban Xia Xie Xin Tang can effectively stop the diarrhea.\n\nHow to differentiate symptoms of diarrhea with blood? If blood appears before the stool, this is not due to colitis but rather external hemorrhoids; if blood appears after the stool, this indicates internal hemorrhoids; if blood and stool are mixed, this is indicative of colitis-related diarrhea.\n\nCheng Wu Ji stated: \"The 'Sheng Ji Jing' says: 'If it is slippery, then the qi is lost...'\"",

How can one tell that there is dry stool in the abdomen? It is indicated by the presence of hard lumps inside. The patient has not had a bowel movement for five or six days, first experiencing pain around the navel, which is a circular pain around the umbilicus.

Yangming heat can be divided into heat in the meridians and heat in the bowels; heat in the intestines corresponds to Chengqi Decoction, while heat in the blood vessels and nerves corresponds to Baihu Decoction. If the pulse is strong, it indicates that there is substantial internal heat, and purging is appropriate. If the pulse is floating and weak, it indicates that there are still exterior symptoms, so one should first induce sweating before addressing the interior. \n\nInducing sweating is advisable, and Guizhi Decoction can still be used for this purpose. When administering Da Chengqi Decoction, it is essential to confirm that the patient does not have exterior symptoms before proceeding with purging.\n\n256.

After a significant bowel movement, if the patient does not have a bowel movement for six or seven days, experiences discomfort, and has abdominal fullness, this indicates the presence of dry stool. The reason for this is also due to retained food, thus \"Da Cheng Qi Tang\" (Major Order the Qi Decoction) is indicated. \n\nIn patients with Yangming syndrome, after administering a purgative, if they still do not have a bowel movement after six or seven days and have abdominal fullness, this indicates the presence of dry stool, which is also due to retained food, thus \"Da Cheng Qi Tang\" is indicated. If, after administering Da Cheng Qi Tang, the dry stool remains, it indicates that the dosage was insufficient, the approach was too gentle, or the prescription was too light. It is acceptable to prescribe Da Cheng Qi Tang again.\n\nIn cases of Da Cheng Qi Tang syndrome, if it is not addressed with Da Cheng Qi Tang, there can be many sequelae. When the patient starts to fidget and cannot lie down, administering Da Cheng Qi Tang at that point may lead to a critical situation. If the patient dies, the family may believe it was due to taking Da Cheng Qi Tang, so it is important to clarify this beforehand. Rather than waiting passively for death, it is better to take the medicine even if it leads to death.\n\n257. If the patient has difficulty urinating, experiences alternating constipation and diarrhea, has occasional slight fever, and cannot lie down due to shortness of breath, this indicates the presence of dry stool, thus \"Da Cheng Qi Tang\" is indicated.\n\nUpon noticing \"difficulty urinating,\" one can infer that the body fluids are depleted. \"Alternating constipation and diarrhea\" indicates that bowel movements are sometimes normal and sometimes not. \"Occasional slight fever\" indicates the absence of cold. \"Shortness of breath and inability to lie down\" suggests the presence of dry stool; these are all symptoms indicating the need for Da Cheng Qi Tang.\n\nWhy does the patient experience shortness of breath? The large intestine is located below, and since the large intestine and lungs are interrelated, when examining lung-related symptoms, there can sometimes be misdiagnosis. For instance, if a patient presents with a yellow tongue coating and shortness of breath, one might prescribe Ma Xing Shi Gan Tang (Ephedra, Apricot Kernel, Licorice, and Gypsum Decoction), which may seem appropriate, but if the patient still cannot lie down and reports not having a bowel movement for five or six days, it prompts further consideration.",

The patient reported not having a bowel movement for five or six days, which led to the consideration of Da Chengqi Decoction. Therefore, before writing a prescription, it is essential to first inquire about the patient's bowel and urinary habits, dietary practices, and sleep patterns. This is a hallmark of a skilled physician.\n\nFor those who feel nauseous after eating grains, this condition belongs to the \"Yangming\" category, and the appropriate treatment is Wu Zhu Yu Decoction. If the symptoms worsen after taking the decoction, it indicates an issue in the upper jiao.\n\nFor conditions such as gastric prolapse, issues related to excessive alcohol consumption, and frequent sour vomiting, the best formula is Wu Zhu Yu Decoction. The phrase \"feeling nauseous after eating grains\" means that if one does not eat, there is no nausea, but upon eating, nausea arises, and there is a desire to vomit. This is classified under Yangming, and Wu Zhu Yu Decoction is the main treatment.\n\nThere are three formulas to consider: First, for severe internal cold, use Si Ni Decoction, as cold indicates a lack of movement, and the gastrointestinal tract is not peristalsing. Second, for milder cold, use Li Zhong Decoction. Third, for even milder cases, use Wu Zhu Yu Decoction, which primarily addresses sour vomiting. The cause of gastric cold is often due to excessive cold in the liver, which affects the stomach and causes it to become cold. Therefore, in clinical practice, when Wu Zhu Yu Decoction symptoms are observed, they are often seen in patients with alcohol-related illnesses, those who have consumed excessive alcohol, as well as patients with liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis, and gastric prolapse. \n\nThus, Wu Zhu Yu Decoction is frequently used in the treatment of liver and gastrointestinal diseases. Wu Zhu Yu itself enters the liver meridian, specifically the foot jueyin and liver meridians. Wu Zhu Yu warms the middle jiao, similar to Gan Jiang, which also warms the middle jiao. However, Gan Jiang primarily warms the spleen and stomach, relying on Ren Shen, Gan Cao, and Da Zao for treating the stomach. Wu Zhu Yu warms the liver but does not tonify the middle. Therefore, when Wu Zhu Yu Decoction is combined with Ren Shen to tonify the middle, it addresses the deficiency of the central qi, enhancing the function of the stomach.",

The only solution is to induce a slight sweat to dispel the heat. At this time, Guadi Powder can be used to induce vomiting, and after expelling water, the patient's skin will produce a little exterior sweat, allowing the floating heat to leave the body.

This condition occurs in many mothers; they often create numerous problems that did not originally exist in the world, such as, \"Which is more important, the daughter-in-law or the mother?\" However, this cannot be spoken out loud, as they know in their hearts that it is wrong, yet they still feel compelled to display many actions. When the son comes home, the two of them hold two pairs of slippers, waiting to see which one the son will wear. Over time, this leads to worry, and worry can harm the lungs. Every day, they think about trivial matters. I often say that the problems in the world are inherently simple, but people complicate them. Therefore, many people suffer from neurasthenia and often fall ill, and even after recovering from illness, they still do not feel well. When you give them Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, they may take it but then vomit; no medicine seems to work. If the illness is deeper, the patient may experience headaches after urination, but gradually, after sixty days, they will start to improve. This indicates a deeper illness because worry can harm the lungs, and the lungs govern the po (魄) and store the po. In our blood, there are two components: one is po, and the other is hun (魂). Worry can harm the lungs, making it impossible for the po to exist in the blood. Therefore, \"if there are spirits,\" it means the lung po is not secure. The hun cannot return to the liver; when the liver blood is damaged, a person becomes weak. In a state of deficiency of both lung qi and liver blood, this deficiency is not a true deficiency. If you give them tonifying herbs for qi and blood, their body may not accept it, and they may vomit the medicine after taking it, making it impossible to help them. When the hun is not secure, the patient cannot sleep. Human sleep requires the hun to return to the liver for a person to fall asleep. For those with neurasthenia or hysteria, if the condition is more severe, after urinating, they might exclaim, \"Wow! My head hurts so much!\"",

Individuals suffering from neurosis or hysteria, particularly in severe cases, may experience symptoms such as, \"Wow! My head hurts!\" after urinating. Why is this? It is due to a deficiency of body fluids. This phenomenon is often observed after a major illness. Additionally, there are many women who worry about their children all day long or spend their time gossiping over afternoon tea, lacking a central viewpoint and not knowing what they truly want. Many of these individuals exhibit signs of neurosis.\n\nIn such conditions, Zhang Zhongjing stated: \"If after sixty days, urination is accompanied by a headache, the illness is more severe, but will improve in sixty days.\" If \"during urination there is no headache, but a sensation of something blowing in the ears, recovery will occur in forty days.\" This sensation indicates a lighter condition. If urination is rapid and accompanied by dizziness, recovery will occur in twenty days. These are observations we can make after a major illness. This syndrome is referred to in Traditional Chinese Medicine as \"Baihe Disease.\" The term \"Baihe\" signifies that it can present with a variety of symptoms, or conversely, it may appear as if there are no symptoms at all. One might say there is no illness, and upon examination at a hospital, it may indeed show no disease; however, the individual still feels unwell throughout their body. If you are the son of such a person, you should seek me as your teacher to learn how to use Baihe Dihuang Decoction, which will alleviate the condition.\n\nThe Baihe Dihuang syndrome can be categorized into several types. The first type is the pure Baihe syndrome. Another type is when the individual initially has Baihe syndrome but has been mistakenly treated with sweating, purging, or vomiting, which further divides it into four formulas. The first is the pure Baihe syndrome. \"Baihe disease does not arise from vomiting, purging, or sweating; the illness manifests as it originally did.\"",

Needle insertion should be two inches deep; this is an injury to the Taiyang channel.\n\nWhat is meant by \"foot cramp\"? This is a type of walking disorder where the patient has no problem moving forward, but cannot stop; if they do stop, it feels as if they will fall, and they must quickly take a few steps forward to stabilize their body. Some patients, when needing to turn left, must first turn around in place before they can continue walking. The feet cannot move freely, which is what is referred to as \"foot cramp.\" In the literature on physiognomy, this is called \"Yu step.\" It is said that during the time of Da Yu, while he was managing the floods, he stood in water for many years, causing cold and dampness to invade the joints, which was the reason for his ailment. As a result, Da Yu's walking style changed, and it was previously called \"Yu step,\" resembling the walk of a duck. A duck's feet do not cross over each other, and such individuals are destined for great wealth. \"Foot cramp\" is caused by cold and dampness, with the main symptom being the inability to stop when walking forward; if they do stop, their body sways. At this time, acupuncture can be performed at the Chengshan point, where we typically use a long three-inch needle.\n\nWhen a lady wearing high heels accidentally falls down the stairs and injures her coccyx, if she was injured in the morning and comes to your clinic in the afternoon, you will notice that there are visible veins appearing between the Weizhong and Chengshan areas, indicating that there is blood stasis. At this moment, do not use acupuncture; instead, use a bloodletting needle to prick the surface of the visible veins and let out a little blood to alleviate the condition. \"In recent years, there are few internal medicine practitioners who can use acupuncture.\" In the past, classical formula practitioners mostly prescribed herbal remedies and rarely used acupuncture.\n\n\"I once suffered from pain in my right arm,\" Cao Yingfu previously experienced pain in his arm, from the shoulder to the Chize point.

However, his daughter, Zhao Hua, treated him with a decoction of ginger and other herbs for a month before he got better. With acupuncture, one needle would suffice. If it is a recent pain, belonging to the category of excess syndrome, simply needling the Shezhu point on the opposite side would resolve it. They do not use acupuncture.

Li Lu resembles a long green onion, but it is longer than an onion.

If the cramping extends into the abdomen, the remedy is Ji Shi Bai San (Chicken Droppings Powder).\n\n**Ji Shi Bai San Formula:**\nTake Ji Shi Bai and grind it into a powder, then mix it with water using a spoon and take it warm.\n\nThe term \"cramping\" refers to muscle spasms, where the arms and legs become rigid. This often occurs suddenly when exposed to cold air or when jumping into cold water, which is the condition treated by Ji Shi Bai San. Nowadays, there is no need to take Ji Shi Bai San. Why was it used in the past? The treatment philosophy in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is very natural and organic. When chickens eat insects, they sometimes consume softer stones as well. After digesting these stones, the chicken's droppings will contain a bit of a yellowish-white substance, which is due to the ingestion of many stones. The calcareous substances that enter the stomach are ground down and transformed into calcium, which is then excreted. This implies that you need to consume calcium, as a deficiency can lead to cramping and stiffness in the muscles and joints, which aligns with Western medical concepts. Therefore, there is no need to take Ji Shi Bai San now; instead, one should consume foods rich in calcium.\n\nFor those with Yin Hu (inguinal hernia), there may be variations in size, with symptoms fluctuating.

If the patient does not have exterior heat but only has floating heat within the body, feeling stuffy, with a pulse that is not very floating, and the patient feels a bit dazed with a slight fever that is not very high, what should be done? The only solution is to induce a slight sweat to dispel the heat. At this time, Guadi Powder can be used to induce vomiting; after expelling water, the patient's skin will produce a little exterior sweat, allowing this floating heat to leave the body. Therefore, Zhang Zhongjing clearly considers the depth and severity of the illness, and it is absolutely essential not to attack the patient when there is internal deficiency. Thus, the master reminds you that if the diarrhea does not stop, the patient will die; his purpose is to alert you that the patient cannot be attacked due to internal deficiency. When the patient is very weak and we need to induce sweating, what should we do? A small amount of Guadi Powder can be used to induce slight sweating; this is the meaning of Zhang Zhongjing.\n\n**Chapter on the Treatment of Yin-Yang Toxicity in Lily Disease**\n\nThis section is very interesting; so far, Western medicine has no effective treatment.

The patient desires to eat but cannot; they often remain silent, wanting to lie down but cannot, wanting to walk but cannot. When food is available, they may either find it appealing or be repulsed by the smell. They may feel cold without being cold, feel hot without being hot, have a bitter mouth, and red urine. No medicine can treat this; if they take medicine, it leads to severe vomiting and diarrhea. If they appear as if possessed, their body is like a harmonious state, and their pulse is weak and rapid. If they experience headaches during urination, it may take sixty days to recover; if there is no headache during urination, it may take forty days to recover; if urination is smooth but there is dizziness, it may take twenty days to recover.",

This condition occurs in many mothers and wives, who often create numerous problems that did not originally exist in the world. For example, \"Which is more important, the daughter-in-law or the mother?\" However, this cannot be spoken aloud, as they know in their hearts that it is wrong, yet they still feel compelled to display many actions. When the son comes home, the two of them hold two pairs of slippers, waiting to see which one the son will choose to wear. Over time, this leads to worry, and worry can harm the lungs. They spend each day thinking about trivial matters. I often say that the problems in the world are inherently simple, but people complicate them. Therefore, many people suffer from neurasthenia and often fall ill, and even after recovering from illness, they still do not feel well. When you give them Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, they may take it but then vomit it back up; no medicine seems to work for them. If the illness is more severe, the patient may experience headaches after urination, but gradually, after sixty days, they will start to improve. This indicates a deeper illness, as worry can damage the lungs, which govern the po (魄) and store the po. In our blood, there are two components: one is po, and the other is hun (魂). Worry can harm the lungs, making it impossible for po to exist in the blood. Therefore, \"if there are spirits,\" it means the lung po is not stable. When the hun cannot return to the liver, it indicates that when the liver blood is damaged, a person will feel weak. In a state of deficiency of both lung qi and liver blood, this deficiency is not a true deficiency; if you give them tonics for qi and blood, their body may not accept it, and they may vomit the medicine after taking it, making it impossible to help them. When the hun is not stable, the patient cannot sleep. Human sleep requires the hun to return to the liver for a person to fall asleep. Individuals with neurasthenia or hysteria, especially in more severe cases, may exclaim, \"Wow! My head hurts a lot!\" after urinating.",

Individuals with neurosis or hysteria, especially those with more severe conditions, may experience symptoms such as, \"Wow! My head hurts!\" after urinating. Why is this? It is because they lack bodily fluids. This situation is often observed after a major illness. Additionally, there are women who worry about their children all day long or spend their time gossiping over afternoon tea, lacking a central viewpoint and not knowing what they truly want. Many of these individuals suffer from neurosis.\n\nIn such circumstances, Zhang Zhongjing stated: \"If after sixty days, urination is accompanied by a headache.\" A headache during urination indicates a more severe condition, which may improve in sixty days. If \"during urination the head does not hurt, but there is a sensation of something blowing in the ears, recovery will occur in forty days.\" This sensation indicates a lighter condition. If urination is rapid and accompanied by dizziness, recovery will occur in twenty days. These are observations we can make after a major illness.

Another type is when the individual initially has Baihe syndrome but has been mistakenly treated with sweating, purging, or vomiting, leading to further differentiation into four formulas. The first is the pure Baihe syndrome. \"Baihe disease does not involve vomiting, purging, or sweating; the condition remains as it initially was.\"",

When needling, insert the needle two inches deep; this is an injury to the Taiyang channel.\n\nWhat is meant by 'fuzhuo'? This is a type of walking disorder where the patient has no problem moving forward, but cannot stop; if they do stop, it feels as if they are about to fall, and they must quickly take a few steps forward to stabilize their body. Some patients, when needing to turn left, must first turn around in place before they can continue walking. The feet cannot move freely, which is what 'fuzhuo' refers to. In the literature on physiognomy, this is called 'Yubu' (the steps of Yu). It is said that during his efforts to control the floods, Da Yu stood in water for many years, and the cold and dampness invaded the joints, which is the cause of this condition. As a result, Da Yu's walking style became like this, which was historically referred to as 'Yubu', resembling the gait of a duck. A duck's feet do not cross over each other, and such individuals are destined for great wealth. 'Fuzhuo' is caused by cold and dampness, with the main symptom being the inability to stop when walking forward; if they do stop, their body sways. At this time, acupuncture can be performed at the Chengshan point, where we typically use a long three-inch needle.\n\nWhen a lady wearing high heels accidentally falls down the stairs and injures her coccyx, if she comes to your clinic in the afternoon after being injured in the morning, you will notice that there are visible veins appearing between the Weizhong and Chengshan areas, indicating that there is blood stasis. At this point, do not use acupuncture; instead, use a bloodletting needle to pierce the surface of the visible veins and let out a little blood, which will suffice.\n\n'In recent times, few internal medicine practitioners are skilled in acupuncture.' In the past, practitioners of classical formulas primarily prescribed herbal remedies and rarely used acupuncture.

When chickens eat insects, they sometimes consume softer stones as well. After digesting these stones, the chicken's droppings will contain a bit of a yellowish-white substance, which is due to the ingestion of many stones. The calcareous substances consumed are ground in the stomach and transformed into calcium, which is then excreted. This implies that one should consume calcium, as a deficiency in calcium can lead to muscle cramps and stiffness in the joints, which aligns with Western medical concepts. Therefore, there is no need to take Ji Shi Bai San now; instead, one should eat foods rich in calcium.\n\nFor those with Yin Hu (inguinal) hernias, there may be variations in size, with symptoms fluctuating. The remedy is Zhu Zi San (Spider Powder).",

          "english_text": "Heat is simply diagnosed in this manner. When a patient suddenly experiences \"palpitations,\" it indicates a deficiency of Qi, particularly when they have an acute onset of shortness of breath. Why does this happen? When the body is deficient, the function of the gastrointestinal system is compromised, and the spleen cannot generate the necessary metal (referring to the production of Qi and blood). The fluids in the lungs rely on the pancreas and spleen for nourishment; the spleen absorbs nutrients and delivers them to the lungs. When the spleen's function is impaired, the patient will experience sudden shortness of breath, indicating a deficiency of Qi, which leads to this condition. Palpitations, in TCM, are also referred to as \"blood deficiency.\" Therefore, one condition is Qi deficiency, and the other is blood deficiency. The symptom of palpitations arises from insufficient strength of the heart, which leads to the sensation of palpitations, termed blood deficiency in TCM. The \"floating pulse\" indicates that the outer aspect of the pulse is Qi; when you palpate it, you feel the Qi pulse but not the blood pulse. Yang represents Qi, while blood represents Yin. When blood is insufficient, Yang rises to the surface, resulting in a pulse that feels large and floating; in reality, the patient is experiencing blood deficiency.\n\nIn men, a pulse that is weak, deep, and wiry, without signs of cold or heat, accompanied by shortness of breath and difficulty breathing, with poor urination, a pale complexion, occasional eye closure, and abdominal fullness, indicates a condition resulting from overexertion.\n\nHere, several symptoms unique to overexertion are presented, and the practitioner categorizes them. If a man has a \"weak, deep, and wiry pulse,\" a weak pulse is one where you can feel a slight pulse, but when pressed harder, it disappears; this is termed a weak pulse. Alternatively, the pulse may be very deep, only palpable near the bone, and again disappears with firm pressure. Or, you may feel a very thin pulse that resembles a string, which is also classified as a weak pulse. In other words, the weak, deep, and wiry pulses all indicate a deficiency of both Qi and blood. The first scenario is that the patient does not exhibit signs of cold or heat. When you ask them, \"Do you feel cold? Do you feel hot?\" they respond, \"No.\" \"Shortness of breath and difficulty breathing\" means that sometimes the patient experiences difficulty when moving slightly.",

Do you feel hot?\" they respond, \"No.\" \"Shortness of breath and urgency\" indicates that the patient sometimes has difficulty breathing even with slight movement, and they often experience abdominal distension and pain. \"Difficult urination\" refers to frequent urination with a small volume. \"Pale complexion\" indicates a sallow appearance. The patient often feels dizzy and may also experience \"epistaxis,\" which means they frequently have nosebleeds. Generally speaking, symptoms like difficult urination suggest that there is a problem with kidney function. A pale complexion indicates an issue with spleen function, as the complexion is derived from the function of the spleen and stomach. Nosebleeds indicate a problem with the liver. \n\nWhy do we discuss these symptoms? The main reason is to inform you that when such conditions arise, it indicates that the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys are all deficient. However, upon examination, the patient may appear quite normal, yet all five organs are simultaneously deficient. This is known as \"labor syndrome,\" as \"this is due to labor.\" These symptoms arise when there is a simultaneous deficiency in the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys.\n\nIn the case of labor syndrome as a disease, the pulse is floating and large, with restlessness in the hands and feet. Symptoms are severe in spring and summer, and milder in autumn and winter. The deficiency of yin leads to the emergence of internal heat, causing soreness and an inability to move. \n\nFor patients with labor syndrome, when they become ill, the pulse is \"floating and large,\" accompanied by \"restlessness in the hands and feet,\" which indicates simultaneous restlessness in the extremities. \"Severe in spring and summer, milder in autumn and winter\" means that this restlessness worsens during the warmer seasons, while it improves in the colder months. This is primarily because individuals with labor syndrome inherently have a deficiency of yin, which causes yang to rise. When the climate is warmer in spring and summer, the internal deficiency heat interacts with the external heat, making the patient feel very uncomfortable. In winter, it is relatively better because of the cold outside.",

          "english_text": "In comparison to heat, when the internal deficiency heat interacts with the external yang heat, the patient feels very uncomfortable. In winter, this condition tends to improve because the cold outside can restrain the heat. Additionally, individuals with severe labor syndrome may experience the phenomenon of \"yin cold essence spontaneously emerging.\"\n\nZhang Zhongjing simply explained that most people suffering from labor syndrome have heat above and cold below, meaning that the area above the navel is hot while the area below is cold. The navel serves as the boundary between yin and yang. The lower part is characterized by yin cold, which signifies a lack of dynamic energy and a cessation of peristalsis, leading to poor metabolism. Conversely, the upper part is excessively hot and overly vigorous. In a healthy individual, yin is above and yang is below, which prevents yang from floating upwards and allows our dynamic energy to remain concealed, referred to as \"latent yang.\" In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), it is not the quantity of yang that matters, but rather its ability to remain hidden.\n\nTherefore, if a patient has yang heat above that cannot descend, this heat will rise to the limbs. At this time, the lower jiao becomes a gathering place for yin cold, leading to the phenomenon of \"essence spontaneously emerging.\" The patient may exhibit several symptoms; for men, this may manifest as nocturnal emissions or dreams of sexual intercourse. Older individuals often experience spontaneous essence leakage due to yang deficiency, which leads to a lack of control, causing essence to leak out involuntarily. This symptom can be very distressing, but can be effectively treated with Chinese herbal medicine.\n\nFurthermore, the symptom of \"soreness and weakness preventing movement\" arises because the lower jiao is deficient and cold, causing essence to leak out. Women do not possess essence, but when this condition occurs in women, it results in excessive vaginal discharge that continuously drips, which can also lead to a sense of depletion. When this phenomenon occurs, it can affect sleep at night. This is because the kidneys govern the bones.",

The differentiation here describes the symptoms that a patient will exhibit when there is a deficiency of body fluids in the lungs, so thirst is a primary distinguishing symptom; in Yangming syndrome, thirst is always present. The expulsion of turbid phlegm indicates that the mucus in the bronchial tubes is being continuously discharged. \"Constantly shivering from the cold, heat causes the blood to stagnate,\" indicates that it is too hot; excessively hot blood can also lead to blood stasis, which results in immobility. At this time, the virus residing in the lungs will gradually erode some of the alveoli and tissues within the lungs. Once the tissues undergo necrosis, they will become purulent. Initially, the sputum may be \"like rice porridge,\" meaning that the phlegm expelled resembles white rice porridge. The term \"rice porridge\" refers to a pneumonia patient who spits out phlegm on the ground; after two or three hours, this phlegm will transform into a large mass of foam because it is filled with viruses. \"When pus forms, death ensues,\" means that the expelled phlegm, resembling a blood clot, sinks when dropped into water. If it floats on the surface, it is not toxic; this is a property of the substance. If the phlegm sinks to the bottom of the water, it indicates how severe the toxicity is. If you say, \"Teacher, Zhang Zhongjing said that when pus forms, death ensues, so we should not treat it and just wait to see if the patient dies,\" although Zhang Zhongjing said this, he still prescribed treatments. Therefore, everyone now understands that when heat accumulates in the lungs for too long and cannot be completely eliminated, one day it will transform into this condition, which in modern Western medicine is referred to as lung cancer.\n\nShortness of breath, facial edema, shoulder breathing, and a pulse that is floating and large—if untreated, it will worsen, especially with diarrhea.

The swelling of the face signifies what we refer to as \"Yang deficiency.\" Once Yang is depleted, the Yang energy rises entirely, and when it reaches the lungs without treatment, it surges up to the head and face, causing facial swelling. \"Shoulder breathing\" indicates that the patient's respiratory system is failing; the heart and lungs are on the verge of exhaustion, requiring the patient to move their shoulders to take a deep breath, as breathing becomes difficult. If at this time the patient's pulse becomes very floating, large, and robust, it signifies the loss of Yang. When the body's kinetic energy and spirit are about to leave the body, these phenomena occur, indicating an incurable condition. \n\nIf there is \"increased diarrhea,\" where the patient experiences incontinence of both urine and feces, it indicates that Yin has also become deficient. After Yang deficiency leads to Yin deficiency, this naturally results in a terminal condition. Therefore, when we see a patient with Yang energy rising, their face flushed, while experiencing diarrhea below, these are very dangerous symptoms, indicating that the internal organs are no longer receiving nourishment from food or medicine. Why is this considered a certain terminal condition? Because at this point, all kinetic energy is rising, and the patient has lost even the peristalsis of the gastrointestinal tract. At this time, when the patient drinks, it immediately exits the body; can you imagine how frightening this is? Isn't this akin to being on the brink of death? The heart, lungs, spleen, and stomach are all failing, and there is no longer any function.\n\nIf there is wheezing and restlessness, this indicates lung distension, which may lead to water retention; sweating can alleviate the condition. \n\nIf the patient exhibits \"wheezing and restlessness,\" it is referred to as \"lung distension.\" In Traditional Chinese Medicine, lung distension clinically resembles what Western medicine describes as emphysema.

          "english_text": "\"Shortness of breath and dryness\" is referred to as \"lung distension.\" In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), what is termed lung distension clinically corresponds to what Western medicine describes as emphysema. There are many causes of emphysema, such as living near factories, particularly cotton or carpet factories, where there is a lot of cotton fluff, or residing in areas with polluted air, like near coal factories. In the past, many miners developed emphysema due to the unclean air they were exposed to. Additionally, the chalk dust generated by teachers writing on blackboards can also lead to emphysema if inhaled excessively. Here, lung distension is essentially modern emphysema. The main symptom of lung distension is a persistent state of inhalation, where the patient is unable to exhale. After inhalation, the patient's lungs can expand but do not contract to expel the air, resulting in a feeling of fullness in that area, making inhalation become very shallow. Zhang Zhongjing provided two prescriptions for treatment: the first is for patients with lung distension who can still lie flat; this is one prescription. If the patient can no longer lie flat, a different prescription is used. Although this is a brief passage, it is written in great detail, and further explanations will be provided in the section on Feng Shui.\n\nLung atrophy, characterized by the expulsion of phlegm without coughing, occurs in individuals who do not feel thirsty and may experience frequent urination. This is due to the deficiency above failing to control the lower aspects. This condition is associated with cold in the lungs, leading to dizziness and excessive phlegm. The prescription for this is Gan Cao (Licorice) and Gan Jiang (Dried Ginger) decoction to warm the lungs. If the patient feels thirsty after taking the decoction, it indicates a case of diabetes.\n\nGan Cao Gan Jiang Decoction:\n- Licorice: 4 taels (roasted)\n- Dried Ginger: 2 taels (processed)\n\nCrush the above ingredients, add 3 sheng (approximately 9 cups) of water, and boil down to 1 sheng and 5 he (approximately 1.5 cups). Strain and take the warm decoction in divided doses.\n\nNow that you all have an understanding of lung atrophy, it can be simply described as lung deficiency. Lung abscess, on the other hand, indicates lung excess; deficiency should be tonified, while excess should be drained. If it is lung atrophy,",

In the early stage of water disease, the cun pulse is \"wiry and tight,\" referring to the pulse of the heart, which broadly indicates the \"upper jiao.\" A wiry pulse represents water, while tightness represents cold, indicating that the upper jiao is affected by cold. \"A wiry pulse indicates that the defensive qi is not circulating, leading to aversion to cold, with water not flowing and accumulating in the intestines.\" This does not refer to the intestines in the literal sense; it should be interpreted as the \"yang\" space, meaning that water naturally accumulates between the skin and muscles, which is the pulse manifestation at the onset of water disease. We must always ensure that the lung yang is sufficient; otherwise, if the lung yang cannot expel the water on the skin as sweat, it will stagnate and accumulate into wind-water.\n\n\"The Shaoyin pulse is tight and deep; tightness indicates pain, while depth indicates water retention, resulting in difficulty urinating.\" This refers to the condition where water disease has already formed. After developing water disease, the kidney function gradually weakens, leading to the \"Shaoyin pulse being tight and deep.\" Depth indicates internal issues, while tightness indicates cold; the kidney function becomes cold, resulting in problems with the drainage system, causing difficulty in urination and leading to edema. Therefore, this corresponds to the Ma Huang, Fu Zi, and Xi Xin Decoction syndrome. The Ma Huang, Fu Zi, and Xi Xin Decoction is a very effective diuretic that can simultaneously strengthen kidney yang and eliminate lung cold.

          "english_text": "A very effective diuretic, it can simultaneously strengthen kidney yang and eliminate lung cold. Therefore, the second point discusses water diseases that have already developed, where the illness penetrates inward. The reason for this inward progression is that the exterior water has not been treated, which allows it to gradually move inward.\n\nWhen the pulse is found to be deep, it indicates the presence of water, leading to body swelling and heaviness. If the pulse of a water disease patient is palpable, it signifies a critical condition. In all cases of edema, the pulse can only be felt at the edges of the bones. When there is an abundance of water, it compresses our blood vessels, causing the blood pulse to be very low; this is a normal manifestation of the disease. \"If the pulse is palpable, the patient is in danger.\" A pulse that is not deep but rather floating indicates a mismatch in pulse symptoms, which is a critical sign that true yang is about to escape. If the water disease has persisted for too long, the entire skin and muscles may necrose, which is a very dangerous symptom. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), a mismatch in pulse symptoms is considered perilous. For instance, if you see a patient who is emaciated and lacks vital energy, yet their pulse is surprisingly strong, it indicates that the patient is in a dangerous state. Conversely, if a very thin and weak patient has a fine pulse, it indicates a matching symptom, and this condition is not life-threatening. Similarly, in cancer patients who lack strength and cannot eat, if their pulse is rapid (nine to ten beats per breath), this indicates a critical condition. Some individuals may appear robust and strong, but if their pulse is thin and weak, this also indicates a mismatch in pulse symptoms, suggesting that the person is nearing death without realizing it.\n\nFor patients with water diseases, one characteristic is \"puffy bags under the eyes,\" which refers to the swelling of the bags under the eyes, exhibiting a somewhat translucent appearance, indicating that the person suffers from thirst due to water retention. Additionally, they may have a distended abdomen and difficulty urinating; if their pulse is deep and absent, it indicates the presence of water, which can be purged. \n\nWater disease patients exhibit several characteristics, the first being \"puffy bags under the eyes,\" which indicates swelling beneath the eyes, showing a somewhat translucent phenomenon, suggesting that the patient is suffering from water retention.",

The first is \"the presence of sleeping silkworms under the eyes,\" which refers to the swelling of the bags under the eyes, appearing somewhat translucent, indicating that the person has a water disease. According to divination texts, if the bags under the eyes are swollen and glossy, resembling pearls, and this occurs on the left side, it signifies a noble son; if on the right side, it signifies a noble daughter. One must not mistakenly think this is simply edema. The second characteristic is \"a fresh and lustrous complexion,\" where the face appears very shiny, which is actually the color of accumulated water. The third phenomenon is \"the pulse is submerged,\" meaning that all water disease pulses are bound to be submerged pulses, as the excess water compresses the blood vessels. The fourth phenomenon is \"the person suffers from thirst due to water disease,\" where individuals with water disease will definitely experience thirst, drinking water but being unable to urinate, resulting in \"abdominal distension,\" where the belly swells, and \"difficult urination.\" Our body's water excretion systems include urination and sweating. If this person can sweat and urinate, they will not experience edema and thus are not classified as having a water disease, but rather as suffering from thirst. \"If the pulse is deep and absent, there is water, and it can be purged.\" The principle of treating water diseases is that above the navel we use sweating methods, while below the navel we employ diuretic methods. In such cases, if urination is difficult and bowel movements are also obstructed, this condition corresponds to the diagnosis of Da Huang Fu Zi Xi Xin Tang.\n\nA question arises: After experiencing diarrhea, if one is thirsty and drinks water, but urination is difficult and the abdomen is distended due to swelling, what does this indicate? The answer is: This condition should be treated as a water disease; if urination is self-regulated and sweating occurs, recovery is expected. \n\nAfter a person experiences diarrhea, the normal state is that the fluids in the stomach and intestines are depleted, leading to thirst and a desire to drink water, hence \"thirsty for water.\" As a result, \"if urination is difficult and the abdomen is distended due to swelling,\" it means that after drinking water, urination is obstructed, causing the entire abdomen to swell.
