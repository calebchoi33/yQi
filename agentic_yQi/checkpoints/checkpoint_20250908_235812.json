Usually due to accumulation in the chest/epigastrium or internal retention of phlegm-fluid (tanyin), with phlegm-fluid extending between chest and abdomen to form localized collections of fluid or edema. Clinically, xin xia pi may occur in acute pancreatitis and other severe abdominal conditions; abdominal or thoracoabdominal CT often demonstrates phlegm-fluid collections or localized edema, and such imaging can serve as objective evidence of internal phlegm-fluid retention. In the Da Xian Xiong Tang pattern, epigastric fullness (xin xia pi) is an important diagnostic sign—when accompanied by CT evidence of phlegm-fluid/edema it supports a diagnosis of heavy phlegm-fluid obstruction and chest-epigastric repletion consistent with the Da Xian Xiong Tang pattern, indicating the need for prompt, aggressive measures to purge and resolve phlegm-fluid with the classical formula.",

Damp-phlegm and water congeal and fail to resolve, presenting as phlegm-fluid stagnation obstructing the chest, palpable epigastric obstruction (xinxiapi), thoracic or abdominal effusion, or interstitial/cavitary fluid accumulation; the fluids are sticky and refractory. Common causes include pathogenic invasion transforming to heat, infection, or acute visceral inflammation (for example acute pancreatitis) leading to internal binding of fluids and generation of turbid phlegm. These collections may be visible on imaging (e.g., CT) as edema or localized fluid collections. Clinical manifestations can include chest oppression, epigastric/distension, a palpable mass under the heart (xinxiapi), cough with copious or sticky sputum difficult to expectorate, oliguria, greasy tongue coating, and a slippery or deep/tight pulse. Phlegm-fluid accumulation obstructs qi movement and may close the chest, producing severe presentations; imaging findings of edema or fluid in conditions such as pancreatitis correspond to the Daxianxiong pattern described in Shanghan Lun.",

In TCM it is usually attributed to internal retention of dampness/fluid from spleen failing to transport, yang deficiency or impaired defensive qi, or to phlegm-fluid congealment and channel obstruction. Clinical features include pitting edema, heaviness of the limbs, facial or local swelling, reduced or clear frequent urination, a swollen tongue with greasy or white coating, and a deep slow or thin weak pulse. When phlegm-fluid obstructs the chest with epigastric/fullness symptoms (the classical da xian xiong pattern), imaging may show large pleural or abdominal effusions; such findings can indicate severe or critical disease and require prompt pattern differentiation and treatment.",

Pathomechanism: phlegm and fluid congeal and combine with heat, blocking the chest and middle burner so qi cannot descend; heat may drive fluid and consolidate masses. Clinical features: epigastric/under-chest fullness and oppression (xinxia pi), chest pain or pressure, inability of qi to descend, coughing up thick yellow sputum, dyspnea or rapid breathing, heavy body sensation, fever, thirst, constipation or dry stools. Typical tongue/pulse: red tongue with yellow or greasy coating, pulse slippery-rapid or submerged and forceful. Modern correlation: may resemble acute pancreatitis with peripancreatic fluid/edema or chest–abdominal fluid collections on CT (edema/effusion). Key differential: must be a true replete (shi) pattern, not xu patterns such as yin or qi deficiency. Principle: vigorous purgation to drain phlegm-fluid and clear heat (jun xia zhu yin, qing re xiao jie). Use is typically short-course, relatively large-dose and requires clear pattern differentiation and administration under experienced clinicians with close monitoring for dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, renal impairment, and other toxic effects; contraindicated in pregnancy, the frail, elderly, qi/blood or yin-deficient patients.",

Common core ingredients and actions: rhubarb (Da Huang, strong cold bitter purgative to drain accumulations, clear heat, promote bowel movement and break up stagnation), mirabilitum (Mang Xiao, a saline laxative that softens hard stools, draws water into the gut and facilitates downward discharge, and helps resolve phlegm-fluid), kansui (Gan Sui, a very strong cold herb that expels water-phlegm and drives out fluid accumulations; pharmacologically and traditionally considered toxic and powerful). Therapeutic rationale: large-dose purgation by Da Huang to open the bowels, Mang Xiao to moisten and ease downward flow, Gan Sui to expel water-phlegm and resolve chest-fluid obstruction. Typical administration characteristics: relatively large doses over a short course to rapidly relieve obstruction; classical practice often uses much larger single-course doses than routine formulas, but modern dosing should be individualized. Possible adjuncts: in some clinical modifications herbs such as Hou Po (Magnolia) or Zhi Shi (Aurantii) may be added to promote qi descent and transform damp-phlegm, but additions must respect the repletion pattern and safety. Contraindications and monitoring: contraindicated in pregnancy; avoid or use extreme caution in the elderly, children, frail patients, those with qi/blood deficiency or yin deficiency. Because ingredients (especially kansui) are potent and can cause dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, renal impairment and cardiac effects, therapy must be short-term under experienced clinician supervision with close monitoring of vital signs, fluid status, urine output, serum electrolytes and renal function. If severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, marked dehydration, altered consciousness, or other serious adverse signs develop, stop treatment and seek emergency care (including imaging and conventional supportive measures) as indicated."
