Usually due to accumulation in the chest/epigastrium or internal retention of phlegm-fluid (tanyin), with phlegm-fluid extending between chest and abdomen to form localized collections of fluid or edema. Clinically, xin xia pi may occur in acute pancreatitis and other severe abdominal conditions; abdominal or thoracoabdominal CT often demonstrates phlegm-fluid collections or localized edema, and such imaging can serve as objective evidence of internal phlegm-fluid retention. In the Da Xian Xiong Tang pattern, epigastric fullness (xin xia pi) is an important diagnostic sign—when accompanied by CT evidence of phlegm-fluid/edema it supports a diagnosis of heavy phlegm-fluid obstruction and chest-epigastric repletion consistent with the Da Xian Xiong Tang pattern, indicating the need for prompt, aggressive measures to purge and resolve phlegm-fluid with the classical formula.",

Damp-phlegm and water congeal and fail to resolve, presenting as phlegm-fluid stagnation obstructing the chest, palpable epigastric obstruction (xinxiapi), thoracic or abdominal effusion, or interstitial/cavitary fluid accumulation; the fluids are sticky and refractory. Common causes include pathogenic invasion transforming to heat, infection, or acute visceral inflammation (for example acute pancreatitis) leading to internal binding of fluids and generation of turbid phlegm. These collections may be visible on imaging (e.g., CT) as edema or localized fluid collections. Clinical manifestations can include chest oppression, epigastric/distension, a palpable mass under the heart (xinxiapi), cough with copious or sticky sputum difficult to expectorate, oliguria, greasy tongue coating, and a slippery or deep/tight pulse. Phlegm-fluid accumulation obstructs qi movement and may close the chest, producing severe presentations; imaging findings of edema or fluid in conditions such as pancreatitis correspond to the Daxianxiong pattern described in Shanghan Lun.",

In TCM it is usually attributed to internal retention of dampness/fluid from spleen failing to transport, yang deficiency or impaired defensive qi, or to phlegm-fluid congealment and channel obstruction. Clinical features include pitting edema, heaviness of the limbs, facial or local swelling, reduced or clear frequent urination, a swollen tongue with greasy or white coating, and a deep slow or thin weak pulse. When phlegm-fluid obstructs the chest with epigastric/fullness symptoms (the classical da xian xiong pattern), imaging may show large pleural or abdominal effusions; such findings can indicate severe or critical disease and require prompt pattern differentiation and treatment.",

Clinical manifestations include chest and epigastric oppression, belching, uncoordinated eructation, upward-flowing qi, shortness of breath, and in severe cases vomiting, coughing or wheezing and upper‑burner fullness. In terms of six-channel (liujing) transmission, when an external disorder moves inward (e.g. from taiyang into yangming or shaoyang) or when the upright qi is disrupted and cold, damp or heat block the course of qi, the normally clockwise circulation of qi is disturbed and descent is impaired.

In TCM vomiting may indicate that an external Taiyang pattern has progressed into Shaoyang (vomiting is characteristic of Shaoyang), or it may arise from impaired spleen-stomach transport with retention of dampness/phlegm that rises and counterflows. The text specifically warns that habitual drinkers (“jiuke”/alcoholics) have damaged stomach function and often react with nausea or vomiting to sweet, sticky herbs (for example the jujube in Gui Zhi Tang); such patients frequently dislike sweet tastes. People prone to vomiting (“tujia”)—those with chronic nausea, epigastric discomfort or occult gastric pain—may have peptic ulcers or gastric masses and should avoid Gui Zhi Tang, because the warming, dispersing action of guizhi and shaoyao can accelerate circulation and provoke vomiting of pus or blood. A greasy yellow thick coating on the tongue suggests damp-heat or phlegm-damp; a thin white coating indicates relatively intact stomach qi. Management focuses on harmonizing the middle jiao, transforming phlegm and directing rebellious qi downward. In alcohol-damaged or chronic-vomiter cases Gui Zhi Tang is contraindicated; alternatives include Ge Gen Qin Lian Tang to clear damp-heat, or adding herbs such as Hou Po and Xing Ren when cough/bronchial phlegm and yellow sputum are present. Clinical caution: recurrent vomiting, vomiting of blood or pus, or vomiting precipitated by Gui Zhi Tang should prompt suspicion of organic gastric disease and careful selection or avoidance of formulas.",

It arises when phlegm-fluid, congealed heat, or vigorous pathogenic repletion obstructs the chest and middle burner so qi cannot descend. Pathomechanism: phlegm and fluid intermix and congeal with heat, or heat drives fluid to aggregate, producing phlegm-heat that blocks the chest and epigastrium and forces qi upward or prevents its downward movement; water accumulation further impairs circulation. Clinically characterized by epigastric/under-chest fullness (xinxia pi), chest oppression or pressure, inability of qi to descend, coughing up thick yellow sputum, dyspnea or rapid breathing, sense of heaviness, fever, thirst or bitter taste, and constipation or dry stools. Tongue often red with yellow thick or yellow-greasy coating; pulse slippery-rapid or submerged and forceful. Within the six-channel differentiation framework this is a true replete obstruction and must be distinguished from xu patterns such as cold deficiency, yin deficiency, or qi/blood deficiency. Modern correlates include pleural/abdominal fluid collections, inflammatory edema or exudates around the pancreas (e.g., acute pancreatitis with peripancreatic/pleuroperitoneal effusion). Treatment principle: vigorous purgation to drain phlegm-fluid, clear heat and open the chest (jun xia zhu yin, qing re xiao jie). Therapy is usually a short-course, relatively large-dose, rapid-acting purgative approach and requires experienced clinicians, close monitoring for dehydration, electrolyte disturbance, renal impairment and herb toxicity. Contraindicated or used with extreme caution in pregnancy, the frail, elderly, children, and those with qi/blood or yin deficiency. Adjunctive herbs that transform phlegm and promote qi descent (e.g., Hou Po, Zhi Shi) may be added when indicated, but only after confirming a true replete pattern; monitor bowel and urine output, vital signs and laboratory indices, and stop treatment and refer for emergency care if severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, altered consciousness or acute organ dysfunction occurs.",

Formulation principle: use large-dose purgation to rapidly open the bowels and relieve chest obstruction, Mang Xiao to moisten and ease descent, Gan Sui to expel water-phlegm and dissolve masses. Administration characteristics: short-course, relatively large doses given with close supervision; some clinical modifications add Hou Po (Magnolia) or Zhi Shi (Aurantii) to promote qi descent and transform phlegm, but additions must respect the replete pattern and safety. Contraindications and precautions: contraindicated in pregnancy; use with extreme caution or avoid in children, the elderly, the frail, and those with qi/blood or yin deficiency. Monitor for dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, renal impairment and cardiovascular instability; check urine output, vital signs and relevant laboratory tests during treatment.

Key manifestations are fever with aversion to wind, headache, spontaneous or slight sweating, chills, and body aches; patients may have intermittent chills, nasal congestion/noise, dry retching, or pruritus from incomplete sweating. Tongue typically shows a thin white coating; pulse is usually floating and moderate/soft. Clinical transformations: floating–tight pulse without sweat indicates exterior–cold (avoid Gui Zhi Tang; use Ma Huang type formulas); a large/wiry pulse or failure to sweat with intermittent fevers may require adding Ma Huang; profuse sweating with great thirst and flood­ing pulse indicates progression to Yangming (switch to Bai Hu style); a faint/forceless pulse or combined yin‑yang vacuity contraindicates further sweating—use nourishing/guarding methods. Special cautions: habitual drinkers (jiuke), chronic vomiters, peptic ulcer or gastric tumor patients often cannot tolerate Gui Zhi Tang (may vomit or bleed) and should receive alternative formulas; greasy/yellow tongue coating suggests damp‑heat not suited to single Gui Zhi Tang. Therapeutic principle: harmonize Ying and Wei, release the muscle layer, protect middle Jiao and fluids—produce gentle sweat to expel the exterior without injuring body fluids. During treatment avoid raw/cold, greasy/sticky foods, strong alliums, alcohol and spoiled foods.",

Common modifications and indications: add Gegen for pronounced nape/back rigidity; add Hou Po and Xing Ren when the patient has cough/wheezing with yellow phlegm (Gui Zhi Tang + Hou Po + Xing Ren) to address concurrent lung heat and damp; for excessive sweating with signs of interior vacuity or limb cramps consider adding Fu Zi (Gui Zhi Jia Fu Zi Tang) to warm and consolidate the exterior; when the exterior is not expelled and fever cycles like malaria or pulse is large, increase Gui Zhi or use formulas with Ma Huang (Gui Zhi Ma Huang halved or Gui Zhi 2:Ma Huang1) to strengthen lung dispersing action; if heavy sweating produces great thirst and big flooding pulse, shift to Bai Hu Jia Ren Shen. Contraindications and practical guidance: do not use when pulse is floating‑tight with no sweat (use Ma Huang type formulas); avoid in habitual drinkers (jiuke), chronic vomiters or patients with gastric ulcers/tumors (risk of vomiting or hematemesis); decoct strongly to extract dispersing qi, after the first dose sip warm thin congee and remain covered until slight sweating occurs—aim for gentle sweat, never profuse; avoid raw/cold, sticky/greasy foods, strong alliums, alcohol/dairy and spoiled food while treating."

        "description": "大青龍湯證為表寒裡熱之候，屬太陽傷寒但已內化熱象。主症為脈浮緊，發熱惡寒，身體疼痛，不出汗而煩躁，喉中癢咳，痰黃濃稠或黃濃，舌苔黃濃，或口渴、胃納不佳、小便短赤或小便不利；並可見心下有水氣、胸悶咳喘、或全身沉重、水腫等水氣證。方性為麻黃湯之變方：加生薑、大棗以扶脾胃、養津；加石膏以清肺熱、瀉裡降逆。與麻黃湯關係緊密（麻黃主發汗解表），又與麻杏甘石湯、越婢湯有配伍與證候區別：若胃口尚好且以肺熱為主，常用麻杏甘石湯；越婢湯則着重利尿取小便。臨床用於疫病或季節反常引起的表寒裡熱、肺熱化燥、以及早期肺胸水飲積聚引起的咳喘、身重、水腫等。同時注意禁忌：脈微弱、汗出、惡風者不可服（此為裡虛失津，不宜石膏瀉去陰液），服用不慎可致厥逆、筋惕肉挛等。煎服時常先煮麻黃以減沫並分次服，若汗出過多以溫粉（牡蠣、龍骨、糯米等研粉）擦拭止汗；臨床可依煩躁、發熱、咳嗽痰多等加減石膏或杏仁，對病情轉變須與麻黃湯、小青龍湯等方比較辨證選用。 / Da Qing Long Tang pattern is an exterior-cold with interior-heat syndrome, a Taiyang (exterior) cold that has transformed into internal heat. Principal signs: floating-tense pulse, fever with chills, body aches, absence of sweating with irritability/restlessness, itchy throat with coughing, thick yellow sticky sputum, yellow greasy tongue coating; may also present with thirst, poor appetite, scanty or difficult urination, water accumulation below the chest (xinxia yinqi), cough and slight dyspnea, generalized heaviness or edema. The formula is a modification of Ma Huang Tang: added Sheng Jiang and Da Zao to support the middle and generate fluids, and Shi Gao to clear lung heat and direct heat downward. Relation to other formulas: closely related to Ma Huang Tang (Ma Huang releases the exterior); distinguished from Ma Xing Gan Shi Tang (Ma Xing Gan Shi) — if appetite is good and pulmonary heat predominates, Ma Xing Gan Shi may be preferred; Yue Bi Tang emphasizes promoting urination. Clinically indicated in epidemic disorders or abnormal seasonal shifts causing exterior-cold with interior lung heat, early pulmonary or thoracic fluid accumulation causing cough/shortness of breath, and whole-body heaviness/edema. Contraindications: do not use when the pulse is frail/weak, there is spontaneous sweating, and fan-wind intolerance (脈微弱、汗出、惡風) — these indicate internal deficiency and insufficient fluids; Shi Gao’s cold-draining action and diaphoresis can further harm fluids and cause collapse (cold reversal, muscular spasms). Decoction technique and dosage adjustments are important: Ma Huang is partly directed outward with Xing Ren while part works with Shi Gao downward; increase Shi Gao for high fever/marked irritability, increase Xing Ren for frequent cough or abundant sputum. If excessive sweating occurs after administration, apply warming powder (wenfen) and stop further doses.",

Decoction: use 9 sheng of water, first boil Ma Huang and reduce by 2 sheng, skim foam, add the other herbs and decoct to obtain 3 sheng; strain and take warm 8 he (approximate classical dose) to produce slight sweating; if one dose causes excessive sweating stop further doses and apply warming powder. Actions and modifications: Ma Huang releases the exterior and opens the lung; part of Ma Huang with Xing Ren is directed to the exterior while part with Shi Gao is directed inward; Shi Gao is cooling and clears lung heat—common amount 4–5 qian, may be increased to 1 liang for marked fever/irritability; Xing Ren commonly 2–5 qian—increase for frequent cough or abundant sputum. If excessive sweating occurs use wenfen (warming powder: oystershell, longgu/dragon bone (equine bone), and glutinous rice, equal parts, powdered) to rub and warm. Contraindications: do not use when pulse is frail/weak, there is spontaneous sweating and wind aversion (indicating interior deficiency); such patients need supportive-warming prescriptions (e.g., Gui Zhi with Fuzi) rather than Da Qing Long Tang. Adjust doses according to constitution and severity in modern practice."

Key signs: epigastric (substernal) water sensation, cough with expectoration of white foamy sputum, wheezy cough, itchy throat, possible low-grade fever without thirst, tongue with white coating, pulse floating or fine. Pathomechanism: exterior cold not resolved with cold-induced retention of fluids in Lung and Stomach producing phlegm-fluid that ascends and causes coughing/retching. Treatment principle: release the exterior and transform fluids, warm the Lung and disperse cold, descend rebellious qi and stop cough, harmonize the Middle. Contrast with Da Qing Long Tang: Xiao Qing Long is for exterior-and-interior cold with white frothy sputum and often a constitutionally cold patient who may become thirsty after fluids are driven off; Da Qing Long Tang treats exterior cold with interior heat, yellow sticky sputum, thirst and irritability. Key modifications: if thirst appears after dosing, representatory cold is resolving and add yin- or fluid-restoring herbs; if patient is thirsty initially remove Ban Xia and add Gua Lou Gen 3 liang; if slight diarrhea (mild stool loosening) remove Ma Huang and add a small amount of Yuan Hua (about size of an egg to decoct to red); if persistent hiccup/eructation remove Ma Huang and add processed Fuzi 1 piece; if urinary difficulty or lower abdominal fullness remove Ma Huang and add Fu Ling 4 liang; for severe wheeze consider adding Xing Ren (apricot kernel) — clinical judgment required.
