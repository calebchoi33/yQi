Usually due to accumulation in the chest/epigastrium or internal retention of phlegm-fluid (tanyin), with phlegm-fluid extending between chest and abdomen to form localized collections of fluid or edema. Clinically, xin xia pi may occur in acute pancreatitis and other severe abdominal conditions; abdominal or thoracoabdominal CT often demonstrates phlegm-fluid collections or localized edema, and such imaging can serve as objective evidence of internal phlegm-fluid retention. In the Da Xian Xiong Tang pattern, epigastric fullness (xin xia pi) is an important diagnostic sign—when accompanied by CT evidence of phlegm-fluid/edema it supports a diagnosis of heavy phlegm-fluid obstruction and chest-epigastric repletion consistent with the Da Xian Xiong Tang pattern, indicating the need for prompt, aggressive measures to purge and resolve phlegm-fluid with the classical formula.",

Damp-phlegm and water congeal and fail to resolve, presenting as phlegm-fluid stagnation obstructing the chest, palpable epigastric obstruction (xinxiapi), thoracic or abdominal effusion, or interstitial/cavitary fluid accumulation; the fluids are sticky and refractory. Common causes include pathogenic invasion transforming to heat, infection, or acute visceral inflammation (for example acute pancreatitis) leading to internal binding of fluids and generation of turbid phlegm. These collections may be visible on imaging (e.g., CT) as edema or localized fluid collections. Clinical manifestations can include chest oppression, epigastric/distension, a palpable mass under the heart (xinxiapi), cough with copious or sticky sputum difficult to expectorate, oliguria, greasy tongue coating, and a slippery or deep/tight pulse. Phlegm-fluid accumulation obstructs qi movement and may close the chest, producing severe presentations; imaging findings of edema or fluid in conditions such as pancreatitis correspond to the Daxianxiong pattern described in Shanghan Lun.",

In TCM it is usually attributed to internal retention of dampness/fluid from spleen failing to transport, yang deficiency or impaired defensive qi, or to phlegm-fluid congealment and channel obstruction. Clinical features include pitting edema, heaviness of the limbs, facial or local swelling, reduced or clear frequent urination, a swollen tongue with greasy or white coating, and a deep slow or thin weak pulse. When phlegm-fluid obstructs the chest with epigastric/fullness symptoms (the classical da xian xiong pattern), imaging may show large pleural or abdominal effusions; such findings can indicate severe or critical disease and require prompt pattern differentiation and treatment.",

Clinical manifestations include chest and epigastric oppression, belching, uncoordinated eructation, upward-flowing qi, shortness of breath, and in severe cases vomiting, coughing or wheezing and upper‑burner fullness. In terms of six-channel (liujing) transmission, when an external disorder moves inward (e.g. from taiyang into yangming or shaoyang) or when the upright qi is disrupted and cold, damp or heat block the course of qi, the normally clockwise circulation of qi is disturbed and descent is impaired. Treatment focuses on unblocking and directing qi downward, harmonizing the middle burner, and selecting formulas according to six‑channel pattern differentiation.",

It arises when phlegm-fluid, congealed heat, or vigorous pathogenic repletion obstructs the chest and middle burner so qi cannot descend. Pathomechanism: phlegm and fluid intermix and congeal with heat, or heat drives fluid to aggregate, producing phlegm-heat that blocks the chest and epigastrium and forces qi upward or prevents its downward movement; water accumulation further impairs circulation. Clinically characterized by epigastric/under-chest fullness (xinxia pi), chest oppression or pressure, inability of qi to descend, coughing up thick yellow sputum, dyspnea or rapid breathing, sense of heaviness, fever, thirst or bitter taste, and constipation or dry stools. Tongue often red with yellow thick or yellow-greasy coating; pulse slippery-rapid or submerged and forceful. Within the six-channel differentiation framework this is a true replete obstruction and must be distinguished from xu patterns such as cold deficiency, yin deficiency, or qi/blood deficiency. Modern correlates include pleural/abdominal fluid collections, inflammatory edema or exudates around the pancreas (e.g., acute pancreatitis with peripancreatic/pleuroperitoneal effusion). Treatment principle: vigorous purgation to drain phlegm-fluid, clear heat and open the chest (jun xia zhu yin, qing re xiao jie). Therapy is usually a short-course, relatively large-dose, rapid-acting purgative approach and requires experienced clinicians, close monitoring for dehydration, electrolyte disturbance, renal impairment and herb toxicity. Contraindicated or used with extreme caution in pregnancy, the frail, elderly, children, and those with qi/blood or yin deficiency. Adjunctive herbs that transform phlegm and promote qi descent (e.g., Hou Po, Zhi Shi) may be added when indicated, but only after confirming a true replete pattern; monitor bowel and urine output, vital signs and laboratory indices, and stop treatment and refer for emergency care if severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, altered consciousness or acute organ dysfunction occurs.",

Da Huang: cold bitter purgative that drains accumulations, clears heat, breaks up stagnation and opens the bowels; Mang Xiao: cold saline laxative that softens hard stools, draws water to the gut to facilitate downward discharge and assists in transforming phlegm-fluid; Gan Sui: very strong cold herb that expels water-phlegm and disperses accumulations in the chest (noted for potent action and toxicity). Formulation principle: use large-dose purgation to rapidly open the bowels and relieve chest obstruction, Mang Xiao to moisten and ease descent, Gan Sui to expel water-phlegm and dissolve masses. Administration characteristics: short-course, relatively large doses given with close supervision; some clinical modifications add Hou Po (Magnolia) or Zhi Shi (Aurantii) to promote qi descent and transform phlegm, but additions must respect the replete pattern and safety. Contraindications and precautions: contraindicated in pregnancy; use with extreme caution or avoid in children, the elderly, the frail, and those with qi/blood or yin deficiency. Monitor for dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, renal impairment and cardiovascular instability; check urine output, vital signs and relevant laboratory tests during treatment. Discontinue and obtain emergency care if severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, altered consciousness or other serious adverse signs occur."
